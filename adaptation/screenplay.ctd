&#8226; Based on partially on Syd Perret and David Jardine. 
&#8226; Wicked sense of humor. 
Background
&#8226; Syd  is a washed out old Asia hand, former foreign correspondent
&#8226; Syd  crusading journo, high ideals in his day.
&#8226; Syd  Arrived in HK in the 60s on a boat like John McBeth.

&#8226; Syd  is a good copy editor, works cheap, always shows up. So Sabam must keep Syd  instincts in check. This is difficult, as he is the last person to see the copy before it goes to the press.  
&#8226; OR speaks fluent Javanese and thoroughly familiar with Jakarta bahasa gaul and allusion
&#8226; Always trying to sneak Pos Kota sex-crime translations into Post when Sabam is preoccupied. Running gag.
&#8226; Sabam cannot fire him because his knowledge of Indonesian culture enables him to pick up potentially damaging references that have escaped the new recruits. Comes out in session with sabam in lapo.
&#8226; Sabam often confers with Syd in office. Syd advises him on reporting government corruption scandal. 
&#8226; Cam always asks how you get away with it. Syd only smiles.
Behavior
&#8226; Syd  lives in room in Jalan Jaksa like David Jardine. 
&#8226; Syd  encourages Julia to read.
&#8226; Syd  Fluent in both proper indonesian and slang, which he used to use in previous job. 
&#8226; Syd does this every few weeks. His skill in rendering tone-perfect translations of articles taken from sensationalist local newspapers, often writing in regional vernacular, has earned him the sobriquet of "cunning linguist" among expatriate readers.

			<rich_text>
&#8226; He had been a brilliant foreign correspondent, too busy to settle down, until he met his Dini, a well-educated, much younger woman from a prominent Padang family. The family hated him, but they were devoted to each other. Dini died in a senseless accident, and family swooped in to take the house and his son. Syd was broken, and never recovered.

&#8226; The first two had been routine commercial runs, with even a flight attendant. 
&#8226; But the third was memorable. 

&#8226; a Nikosoren, was one of a score barely serviceable planes the Japanese had left behind. The air force mechanics kept these aircraft flying through skill and guesswork, but Muharto was aware that any flight could end in disaster. To keep his mind from this eventuality, Muharto  thought about the American pilots he had met during the blockade runs he had organized from Singapore to Jogjakarta. He  decided that only Bob Freeberg possessed the skill and nerve to land at night on a remote beach. Bob had been the pilot of the third blockade run. Though these had been standard charter flights -- they even had a flight attendant, a lovely Filipina named Miss Brown -- the third flight would test the skills of any aviator.  
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On 25 September 1988, Cameron Bishop, an American journalism student interning at The Jakarta
Post as a copy editor, sits with retired Air Force Major Petit Muharto at his home in Jakarta. Muharto had asked his old friend Sabam Siagian, the English-language newspaper's managing editor, to publish a story commemorating Bob Freeberg on the 40th anniversary of his mysterious disappearance on 1 October 1948. Muharto begins his narrative by telling Cameron of a message he received one morning at his desk in Maguwo air base in Jogjakarta.</rich_text>

of a building in the colonial-era section of Jakarta. The building is one municipal inspection away from
being condemned. An ancient air conditioner wheezes over a window, having no discernible effect on the heat and humidity. The office has a single occupant: Victor, a slight, elderly man of
sallow complexion, is the only person in the office who is openly delighted
at receiving company. Julia introduces Cameron and explains the purpose
of their visit. The negatives and prints of the collection are stored in tattered folders
placed seemingly at random, but Victor strides confidently to
a shelf, pulls out a folder from the middle of a pile, and brings it
back to the desk. He leafs through the folder and pulls out a strip of
negatives showing a large American standing in front of an airplane. It
is Bob Freeberg and RI-002. Victor repeats the process and shows Cameron
images of Spoor in his office. Victor explains that his desk was located in the hallway outside Spoor's office, and on many occasion overheared Spoor raging about the foreign pilots running the Dutch blockade with impunity.

for a Manila-based charter airline, as captain. Amid poor visibility
over Java, Bob demonstrates his piloting skill by diving through a break
in the clouds, leveling off under the cloud cover a few hundred meters
above the ground. Muharto spots a railway line, and tells Bob that it
leads along the valley to terminate in Jogja. Bob follows the line,
barely visible through the rain, and jokingly asks Muharto if there are
any tunnels between here the Jogja. The look on Muharto's face suggests
that he is not entirely sure.

parachute of one trooper opens and dumps onto the cabin floor. The
trooper swears it was an accident, but all others accuse him of
cowardice. The troopers look at each other, wondering if any one will be
next. Boedi enters the cabin. Though he is only an airman, the
charismatic Boedi takes command of the situation, assuring the troopers
that Bob has much wartime experience flying paratroopers and will drop
them safely. He goes to the cockpit and talks with Bob for a moment. The
Bob turns the aircraft over to his co pilot, leaves his seat and stands
in the doorway, his body filling the frame. With Boedi translating, Bob
assures the troops that he has done this many times during the war, and
will drop them exactly on the requested target. Emboldened by Bobs air
of quiet competence, each trooper moves forward and shakes Bobs hand.
Bob returns to his seat, the dropmaster issues the command to jump, and
the cabin empties, save for the dropmaster and a lone recruit wondering
what fate is in store for him back at Maguwo. Boedi watches as the
parachutes drift down and land are enveloped by the endless forest.
Boedi asks Bob how many paradrops he made. Bob grins and answers: "None.
I was a Navy pilot. All my missions were over water."

Muharto tells Cameron that on the afternoon of 1 October 1948 he heard
reports that RI-002 had not arrived at Bukittinggi. In the following
days, the Dutch denied any knowledge of the disappearance, and the
Republic was unable to mount more than a cursory search. Muharto shows
Cameron a clipping dated 1983 about rattan gatherers finding wreckage on
a remote mountain in South Sumatra. Muharto said that he used his AURI
credentials to research the archives for the investigation report. He
found, to his astonishment, that the wreckage had actually been
discovered in April 1977.

</rich_text><rich_text>In 1980 Muharto writes to his contacts
in the Air Force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site
investigation, but receives vague, non-committal replies --- or only
silence. He then tries his luck in Air Force archives and government libraries, but finds only disorder or even active obstruction as civil-service librarians question his qualifications and motives. The only solid result of his efforts is the report on the investigation of the crash site. One intriguing document is a photograph of a radio-set dynamo with a bullet lodged in the windings. </rich_text>

a Harley Davidson engine. When he lands, Suryadarma is waiting, and
angrily orders him back to his desk.

&#8226; Muharto stays with Bob's friend Tom Lee, a government lawyer. 
&#8226; Over breakfast, Tom reads the newspaper headlines
&#8226; about "Fearless Bob Freeberg" and his "Javanese Crew". 
&#8226; One article reports that the Dutch are laying claim to the valuable quinine cargo as the "Javanese Crew" are "subjects of the Dutch Queen". 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On  12 June 1947 Dutch representatives in Manila sue Muharto and Pang in civil court for possession of the quinine. Fortunately, Muharto's celebrity status also attracts the attention of Salipada Penatun, a sitting Senator as well as a practicing lawyer. His family has close cultural ties to Indonesia, and so offers his services pro bono. </rich_text>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On 13 June 1947 Bob and Muharto are challenging the Dutch claim over the quinine cargo.
Their lawyer, Salipada Penatun lays out the legal justification for
ownership of the quinine, then lets Muharto give an impassioned plea,
claiming that the money from selling the quinine will buy medicines and
other essentials unavailable in the besieged capital. The Dutch counter
by calling a plantation expert to testify that the Republic does not
have the capability to process quinine, so the drug must have been
produced in a Dutch-owed factory before the war. Muharto jumps to his
feet, ready to protest this insult to his people's technological skill,
but Penatun motions for him to sit down, then calmly tells the judge: "A
foreigner is not qualified to discuss the internal matters of the
sovereign Republic of Indonesia." The judge considers this with some
sympathy, declines to allow the expert witness, and adjourns the
session. </rich_text>

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On 29 July 1947, Bob invites Muharto, Pang, and Boedi to his apartment to celebrate that
morning's verdict awarding the quinine to them. Bob's housemate has a
military-grade short-wave radio, which Boedi immediately switches on and
scans the military and civilian frequencies. The party mood vanishes
when a news broadcast announces that an Indian blockade runner has been
shot down on approach to Maguwo. All look toward Bob, and he nods in

Though Muharto protests whenever Bob picks up the bill for their bowls of curry, Bob insists that as captain of RI-002 he is responsible for their well-being until he returns them safely to Java.

giggling as they describe a range of low, rounded hills near Jogja as
female breasts. He soon spots the distinctive geographic feature and,
now oriented, guides Bob to a safe landing in Jogja.

&#8226; &#8226; Boedi also recounts events that Muharto did not mention, recalling Muharto's terror-stricken look during the November 1947 incident when Freeberg, who had flown through typhoons, dove into the heart of a violent storm to evade a Dutch patrol.
&#8226; Muharto tells Cameron that Bob became an invaluable link between the
besieged republic and the outside world, flying high-value agricultural
products to Singapore and Manila, and returning with medicine and spare
parts for vehicles, generators, and the like. Though essential, the
missions were hardly exciting or glamorous, though there were moments.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In mid November 1947, Muharto spots an small airplane near the horizon as they fly near Dutch
territory. This is most likely a Dutch fighter on patrol, so Bob steers
RI-002 into a tropical storm. Boedi grins when he sees Muharto's
terrified face as the Dakota is violently buffeted, with sickening
plunges in altitude. Bob tells Muharto to not worry; when a Navy test
pilot he would fly through typhoons.

In mid October 1988, Julia is processing a shipment of English-language books about Indonesia for inclusion in the library collection. One book, *Our Hotel in Bali*, catches her eye, as the author is Louise Koke. A quick glance at the contents confirms that Louise is the wife of Robert Koke, and the book about the couple running Bali's first "bohemian-chic" hotel in the 1930s. The portrait of Robert Koke emerging from the pages wholly contradicts the perception of a CIA officer seeking to destabilize a regime. Julia writes a letter to the publisher, requesting it be passed to the Kokes.

Nevertheless, the nephew is enthralled by the stories, so he used Julia's letter as an excuse to ply his uncle with a few whiskeys. The nephew is a born storyteller himself, and Julia is immediately drawn into the vivid descriptions of events in post-war Batavia, at least those that are not still classified intelligence, even 40 years on. </rich_text>

He introduces Cameron to the owner, Sanyoto had been a drill sergeant in the Air Force, then worked as a fixer for foreign oil companies until he retired and opened the bar. Sanyoto maintains wide contacts in the highest levels of government and the military, so the Earthquake is popular with generals and cabinet ministers. Sanyoto tells Cameron that, as a friend of Syd, he is always welcome here, as long as he minds his manners and doesn't "needle" any of his regular guests. 

That evening, the music is supplied by a band playing keroncong, a guitar-driven genre that features sentimental Dutch-language lyrics. Regarded as "music for old folks" the audience of senior and retired military officers laps it up. Afterward, Sanyoto introduces Syd and Cameron to Samuel Quiko, the band leader. Sanyoto mentions that Samuel had been active in the revolution, and might have interesting stories to tell.

Merapi volcano to meet Muharto's spiritual advisor, Mbah Maridjan. The
three hike the steep incline to a shrine; effortlessly in the case of
the sexagenarian duo of Muharto and Maridjan; with some difficulty by
their companion, some four decades their junior. Cameron watches
respectfully as the two intone Islamic prayers, then lay Hindu-style
floral offerings at the shrine to the gods of the mountain.

Afterward, Muharto takes Cameron to the Air Force museum, a re-purposed hanger
filled with decommissioned aircraft and other exhibits. Muharto points
to a model of the Zogling training glider, and tells Cameron of training
village boys who had never seen an airplane to become skilled pilots in
mere weeks. Grinning, he tells of the time he fly one himself.

In the museum, Muharto seeks out the curator, who invites them into his office. Muharto
asks the curator to retrieve scraps from the RI-002 wreckage stored at
the museum. One of the items is the dynamo with the bullet inexplicably
lodged in the windings. Muharto picks it up, and from his point of view,
the room around him fades into mist.

Muharto is astounded to realize he is somehow in the radio nook of
RI-002 on the day of the crash. The airplane shutters as the engines scream in protest. Muharto
sees two shadowy figures in the pilot seats, and a forested mountainside
fills the window.

The museum office comes back into focus, and Muharto sees the concerned
faces of Cameron and the curator. Muharto places the dynamo back into
the storage box and says, in a wavering voice, that they will miss their
train back to Jakarta if they don't hurry.
