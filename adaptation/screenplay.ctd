stronghold in the forests of Kalimantan. None have jumped before, or
even been in a aircraft, so tension is high. There is an uproar as the
parachute of one trooper opens and dumps onto the cabin floor. The
trooper swears it was an accident, but all others accuse him of
cowardice. The troopers look at each other, wondering if any one will be
next. Boedi enters the cabin. Though he is only an airman, the
charismatic Boedi takes command of the situation, assuring the troopers
that Bob has much wartime experience flying paratroopers and will drop
them safely. He goes to the cockpit and talks with Bob for a moment. The
Bob turns the aircraft over to his co pilot, leaves his seat and stands
in the doorway, his body filling the frame. With Boedi translating, Bob
assures the troops that he has done this many times during the war, and
will drop them exactly on the requested target. Emboldened by Bobs air
of quiet competence, each trooper moves forward and shakes Bobs hand.
Bob returns to his seat, the dropmaster issues the command to jump, and
the cabin empties, save for the dropmaster and a lone recruit wondering
what fate is in store for him back at Maguwo. Boedi watches as the
parachutes drift down and land are enveloped by the endless forest.
Boedi asks Bob how many paradrops he made. Bob grins and answers: &quot;None.
I was a Navy pilot. All my missions were over water.&quot;

Cameron a clipping dated 1983 about rattan gatherers finding wreckage on
a remote mountain in South Sumatra. Muharto said that he used his AURI
credentials to research the archives for the investigation report. He
found, to his astonishment, that the wreckage had actually been
discovered in April 1977.

In the gathering darkness, Muharto has difficulty identifying landmarks.
Tension mounts in the cabin as the fuels gauges slide toward empty. Bob
admonishes Muharto saying: &quot;This is your country, you should now where
we are!&quot; Muharto draws on the vivid schoolboy memory of his classmates
giggling as they describe a range of low, rounded hills near Jogja as
female breasts. He soon spots the distinctive geographic feature and,
now oriented, guides Bob to a safe landing in Jogja.

• Muharto tells Cameron that Bob became an invaluable link between the
besieged republic and the outside world, flying high-value agricultural
products to Singapore and Manila, and returning with medicine and spare
parts for vehicles, generators, and the like. Though essential, the
missions were hardly exciting or glamorous, though there were moments.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In mid November 1947, Muharto spots an small airplane near the horizon as they fly near Dutch
territory. This is most likely a Dutch fighter on patrol, so Bob steers
RI-002 into a tropical storm. Boedi grins when he sees Muharto's
terrified face as the Dakota is violently buffeted, with sickening
plunges in altitude. Bob tells Muharto to not worry; when a Navy test
pilot he would fly through typhoons.

Julia finds *Our Hotel in Bali* in a newly opened bookstore selling English-language books. The portrait of Robert Koke that emerged from the book seemed totally at odds with the perception of a CIA officer seeking to destabilize a regime. Julia tracks down a Balinese employee mentioned in the book who went on to become a hotel professional. He confirms the respect the Kokes held for the Balinese and Indonesians in general, and supplies the name of an acquaintance who encountered Koke in post-war Batavia.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In early October 1988, Muharto takes Cameron to visit Pang Soeparto. Pang is effusive in praising Muharto for winning the court case for the quinine, and how Muharto kept up spirits during the weeks of penury trying to sell the quinine and return home.

				<rich_text>In mid October 1988 Julia and Cameron enter the IPPHOS office, located on the ground floor
of a building in the colonial-era section of Jakarta and one municiple inspection away from
being condemned. An ancient air conditioner wheezes over a window, having no discernible effect on the heat and humidity. The office has a single occupant: Victor, a slight, elderly man of
sallow complexion, is the only person in the office who is openly delighted
at receiving company. Julia introduces Cameron and explains the purpose
of their visit. The negatives and prints of the collection are stored in tattered folders
placed seemingly at random, but Victor strides confidently to
a shelf, pulls out a folder from the middle of a pile, and brings it
back to the desk. He leafs through the folder and pulls out a strip of
negatives showing a large American standing in front of an airplane. It
is Bob Freeberg and RI-002. Victor repeats the process and shows Cameron
images of Spoor in his office. Victor explains that he was a recruit posted to KNIL headquarters as an photographer analyst. His desk was close to Spoor's office, and remembers on many occasion overhearing Spoor raging about the foreign pilots running the Dutch blockade with impunity.

					<rich_text>Victor searches for more shots of Batavia to prod his memory about
Spoor's efforts to stop the blockade runs. He stops when he comes across
a photo of a strikingly beautiful Indonesian woman who, though dressed in baggy, paint-splattered overalls radiates elegance
and poise. The caption reads
&quot;Emeria Soenassa in her studio 1948&quot;. Julia asks Victor who she is.
Victor replies &quot;No one important&quot;, snatches the photo from the table and
files it away.

Merapi volcano to meet Muharto's spiritual advisor, Mbah Maridjan. The
three hike the steep incline to a shrine; effortlessly in the case of
the sexagenarian duo of Muharto and Maridjan; with some difficulty by
their companion, some four decades their junior. Cameron watches
respectfully as the two intone Islamic prayers, then lay Hindu-style
floral offerings at the shrine to the gods of the mountain.

• • Shows Cameron the innovative aircraft of early years of AURI, and his desire to fly, always thwarted by Suryadarma.  
• Goes into trance handling the RI-002 dynamo
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
On 10 October 1988 in the museum, Muharto seeks out the curator, who invites them into his office. Muharto
asks the curator to retrieve scraps from the RI-002 wreckage stored at
the museum. One of the items is the dynamo with the bullet inexplicably
lodged in the windings. Muharto picks it up, and from his point of view,
the room around him fades into mist.

Muharto is astounded to realize he is somehow in the radio nook of
RI-002 on the day of the crash. The airplane shutters as the engines scream in protest. Muharto
sees two shadowy figures in the pilot seats, and a forested mountainside
fills the window.

The museum office comes back into focus, and Muharto sees the concerned
faces of Cameron and the curator. Muharto places the dynamo back into
the storage box and says, in a wavering voice, that they will miss their
train back to Jakarta if they don't hurry.
