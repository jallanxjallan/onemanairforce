• Cameron mentions hearing of military corruption plan
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In an unguarded (and unclothed) moment, Cameron tells Julia about the
Jakarta Post investigations into Army officers seeking to influence the
emerging capital market through leaking false information to pump up
stock values. Julia realizes that this must be the deal her father is
involved in.</rich_text>

Cameron tells Julia that he has to tell Muharto that we don't know what happened, that Agus thinks Bob might have been in on it. Julia says: &quot;Are you going to break the heart of two old men in one day?&quot; Cameron tells Muharto that Bob had been in chains and looked like he as beaten up. 
Visiting Muharto and Ani on his way to the airport, Cameron and Muharto piece together the events of the last flight of RI-002 based on what they have learned. Freeberg's role in this remains unclear. With the memory of Victor's crushing dismay a few hours before still vivid Cameron decides to comfort his friend by falsely claiming that Anwar Congo had seen Freeberg being led away in chains with signs of having been assaulted.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Muharto finishes the narrative saying that the RI-002 wreckage was eventually discovered on a mountain in Sumatra in 1977. The few fragments of human remains could not be identified, and no gold was found. Muharto’s expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto wonders that if he had turned down promotion and had been with Bob on the final flight, maybe it would not have ended in tragedy.

John Coast describes his first meeting with Freeberg in Bangkok with members of the Aviation brotherhood, who complain that he is monopolizing the Indonesian flights. Freeberg is drunk, and complains privately to Coast about both the Indonesians, who owe him thousands of dollars, and the American diplomats, who seem to treat him as a criminal.  
Cameron reads about the political situation
in post-war Indonesia, and the high regard the various foreign
diplomats, journalists, and academics held for Freeberg. However,
American government representatives in Batavia strongly disapproved of
Freeberg's blockade runs, regarding him as a borderline criminal.</rich_text>

At the IPPHOS office, the ground floor of a building one inspection away from being condemned, Victor indeed finds a photo of Freeberg after a brief search. Victor runs the office alone, and sees few visitors, so he invites Cameron to stay for coffee. Victor tells Cameron that he had been a Dutch army conscript who had defected to the Indonesian side in the final days of the struggle. In Batavia he had been posted in the survey department developing and analyzing field photographs, but in his final year had been transfered to KNIL headquarters as &quot;official photographer&quot;, working directly under General Simon Spoor, the commander of all colonial military forces. Spoor was a strict, humorless martinet universally hated by his subordinates and convinced that the Republicans were no more than thugs and bandits. Victor had often heard Spoor's voice rise in fury as he is briefed about Freeberg's daily blockade runs, which he seems to take as a personal affront.

Cameron goes to the Affandi Museum and meets the master painter. Affandi tells of the difficult life in Jogja during the struggle. Trying to paint people who are starving, failing to save a captured soldier from being shot just after he painted him. Affandi is full of praise for Freeberg, who he painted for a propaganda poster. Affandi declares Cameron to be his new friend. He 
dashes off a self-portrait in seconds, signs it, and gives it to Cameron to give to Boedi. </rich_text>
