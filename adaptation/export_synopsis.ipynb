       "In September 1988, Cameron Bishop, an American journalism grad student interning as a language consultant at The Jakarta Post, pleads with editor Sabam Siagian to be allowed to investigate and write stories. Sabam explains, yet again, that this not allowed. Instead, he assigns Cameron to write a puff piece about his friend Petit Muharto's experiences flying blockade runs with American mercenary Bob Freeburg during Indonesia's post-war struggle for independence. \n",
       "Cameron meets Muharto at his tidy home in south Jakarta. The retired Air Force officer tells of meeting Freeberg when the latter had made an emergency landing on a remote beach and of Freeberg being commissioned to fly for the Republic with the fictitious registration of RI-002. Muharto emphasizes the value of the blockade runs to the struggle for independence, and the respect and affection Bob received from all Indonesians, from President Soekarno to the common people of Jogjakarta. Muharto says he flew with Freeberg until May 1948, when he was promoted to major and assigned to headquarters. Four months later, Muharto was devastated to learn that RI-002 had vanished while transporting Republican gold from Java to safety in Sumatra ahead of an expected Dutch invasion. The RI-002 wreckage was found on a mountain in Sumatra in 1977. The gold was missing, and the mystery of the disappearance was never solved.  \n"
