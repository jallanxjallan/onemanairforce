```synopsis
Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob’s
remains, could not be buried with the others as a foreigner cannot be interred in a cemetery for national heroes, however much he may deserve the honor himself through his services to the nation.

Muharto’s expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying,
wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of
RI-002 than they are telling.

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob’s
remains, could not be buried with the others because he was a foreigner.
Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash
site, wholly accident, some five years previously. He wrote his
contacts in the air force and to the officers who participated in the
crash-site investigation, but received only vague, non-committal replies
– or only silence. Muharto’s expression as he finished his
reminiscences convinces Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close
friend, and is seeking closure about his mysterious disappearance.
Muharto finishes by saying, wistfully, that his is sure many people know more
about the mystery of RI-002 than they are telling.
