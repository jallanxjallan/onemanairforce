Muharto stands in the cockpit between Bob and his co-pilot, guiding the
aircraft by landmarks he has seen twice before on previous blockade
runs. But today, overcast obscures the terrain save tops of the
volcanoes poking through the clouds. Miss Brown, a comely Filipina who,
incongruously, is the stewardess on what is basically an illegal flight,
hands Muharto a cup of tea, then looks at the solid overcast with
obvious concern.

Bob points to the peaks and asks if there is any high ground in between.
Muharto thinks for a moment, then replies: I don't think so. Nothing
above a few hundred meters. To Muharto's horror, Bob noses the aircraft
down through the overcast, emerging perilously close to the terrain.
Muharto gulps, and frantically looks for any type of landmark. He sees a
rail line that he knows will lead them through valleys and plains all
the way to Jogja. He tells Bob to follow that line, and Jogja appears a
few minutes later, to Miss Brown's great relief.
