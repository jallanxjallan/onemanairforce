Samuel visits Muhammad Arif, the leader of the preman gang whose territory includes Kampung Tugu. Samuel reminds Arif that since both Dutch and Indonesian residents of Batavia love keroncong music, Samuel can enter both elite European venues and native neighborhoods without arousing suspicion. Samuel offers to serve the Republic by acting as a courier if Arif agrees to keep the roving gangs away from Kampung Tugu.
