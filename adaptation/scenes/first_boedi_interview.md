Muharto takes Cameron to interview Boediardjo, the RI-002 radio operator
who shot through the ranks to be appointed Air Force commander and,
after retirement, Minister of Information and Ambassador to Spain. Boedi
starts off with a laugh at Muharto's expense, as he describes Muharto's
first experience in the co-pilot seat of RI-002.
