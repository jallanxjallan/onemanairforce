Freeberg's haggard appearance and premature greying reflects the constant strain of being the Republic's "One Man Air Force". In May 1948 Muharto is offered a promotion to major and reassignment to a desk job. Worried about his friend, Muharto considers declining the promotion. However, he is now engaged to his girlfiend Ani, and must think about their future. 

Busy with his own duties, Muharto sees little of Freeberg until 30  September 1948, when he visited his friend as he was readying RI-002 to  ferry Republican gold to safety in Sumatra ahead of a feared invasion of Jogja. Freeberg had seemed tired and distracted, nothing like the cheerful, competent pilot of the previous year. RI-002 was reported  missing on the following day.
