Muharto tells Cameron that he met Pang Suparto at the Tasik army base. They brought two barrels of aviation fuel to the beach where
the mystery aircraft is stranded. When Muharto saw the beach, bookended by two rivers and the gap between the water and palm trees scarcely wider than the Dakota's wing span, he knew that he had been correct in his guess. Of all the CALI pilots he had met, only Bob Freeberg had the skill to make that landing.
