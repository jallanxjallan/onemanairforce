Muharto tells Cameron that he met Pang Suparto at the army base. and
together they take two barrels of aviation fuel to the beach where
Freeberg is stranded. He tells Cameron that when he saw the beach, bookended by two rivers and the gap between the water and palm trees scarcely wider than the Dakota's wing span, he knew that only Bob Freeberg had the skill to make that landing.
