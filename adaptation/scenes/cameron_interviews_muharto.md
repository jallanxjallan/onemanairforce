Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting
with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when
they hear the roar of a large motorcycle approaching. Muharto, in jest,
covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in
front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani
opens it to find Cameron, in jeans and motorcycle boots, asking for
Muharto. Once over his surprise at being interviewed by a "Hell's Angel" Muharto
tells the story of the Bob Freeberg and RI-002, beginning with a
surprising telephone call he received while on duty in Maguwo Air Base in Jogjakarta.
