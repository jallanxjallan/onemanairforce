In Bukittinggi, Dave Fowler looks on in shock as the right-side landing
gear collapses just as RI-002 is planning to take off. Bob grins, and
says: "You know how it is. 99 times out of a hundred you can get away
with it." Fowler replies: "I guess this was the 100th time."

Bob and the ground crew jack up the wing on blocks as Bob resets the
gear, then walks along the wing checking for cracks. He sees one sizable
crack, kneels down to inspect it, then shouts to Fowler that "it will
hold", Bob goes back to the cabin, fires up the engines, and takes off
while Dave Fowler shakes his head.
