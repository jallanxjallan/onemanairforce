Muharto tells Cameron that on the afternoon of 1 October he heard reports that RI-002 had not arrived at Bukittinggi. In the following days, the Dutch denied any knowledge of the disappearance, and the Republic was unable to mount more than a cursory search. Muharto shows Cameron a clipping dated 1983 about ratten gatherers finding wreckage on a remote mountain in South Sumatra. Muharto said that he used his AURI credentials to research the archives for the investigation report. He found, to his astonishment, that the wreckage had actually been discovered in April 1977.
