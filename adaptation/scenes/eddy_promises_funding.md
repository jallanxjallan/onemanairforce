Eddy tells Julia that he is determined to fulfill
the dream of his only child to study overseas. Julia reminds him that
his nickname is "Honest Eddy" and that his only income is his military
wage. Eddy replies that he is making arrangements. Julia is doubtful,
but agrees to go along with whatever he plans, as long as it is not an
arranged marriage to some rich brat.
