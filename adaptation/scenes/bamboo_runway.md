As Muharto and Pang walk over the soft sand toward the Dakota, Muharto can see that he was correct. It is Bob Freeberg, who is digging the sand from around one of the wheels. 
 Muharto sees that the Dakota is undamaged but stuck in the soft sand. They first try to fashion a runway from coconut fronds, but the leaves disintegrate under the wheels of the heavy Dakota. Buy this time hundreds of villagers had arrived to witness the outlandish spectacle. Muharto looks around the village, and notices that most houses have walls of woven bamboo. He gets an idea, climbs with Bob onto the wing of  the Dakota, and launches into an impassioned speech saying that this brave foreigner is our friend and will help us drive the despised Dutch from our land. The villagers cheer, and Muharto is joined by Pang, the army officer, who tells the assembled crowd to, literally, tear their own houses apart to lay the bamboo mats on the sand.  A few hours later, the Dakota, which Muharto on board, takes off and flies away, the mats flying backwards in the propeller backwash.
