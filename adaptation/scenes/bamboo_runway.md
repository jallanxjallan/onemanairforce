# Treatment

As Muharto and Pang walk over
the soft sand toward the Dakota, Muharto sees Bob Freeberg crouched beside a wheel, digging away the sand with a shovel. The man turns around and grins when he sees Muharto approaching. 

Muharto sees that the Dakota is undamaged but stuck in the soft sand.
They first try to fashion a runway from coconut fronds, but the leaves
disintegrate under the wheels of the heavy Dakota. By this time
hundreds of villagers had arrived to witness the outlandish spectacle.
Muharto looks around the village, and notices that most houses have
walls of woven bamboo. He gets an idea, climbs with Bob onto the wing of
the Dakota, and launches into an impassioned speech saying that this
brave foreigner is our friend and will help us drive the despised Dutch
from our land. The villagers cheer, and Muharto is joined by Pang, the
army officer, who tells the assembled crowd to, literally, tear their
own houses apart to lay the bamboo mats on the sand. A few hours later,
the Dakota, which Muharto on board, takes off and flies away, the mats
flying backwards in the propeller backwash.
