Muharto and Pang marvel that Freeberg had been able to land on this short stretch of beach, bookended by high bluffs. Muharto recognizes Freeberg and they greet as friends. Fearing that a patrolling Dutch fighter could appear at any time, Muharto, in a stirring speech, implores the assembled villagers to tear apart their houses to fashion an improvised runway from the bamboo mats used as walls. They do so, and with Muharto and Pang on board, the Dakota takes off and flies to Maguwo.
