The day after the Freeberg article is published, Muharto visits Jakarta Post to pick up any available extra copies to give to friends and colleagues. Sabam invites Muharto to sit at the staff table in the newsroom while he waits, and orders tea for him. Cameron and Syd grab their coffees, Syd pouring a splash of whiskey into his, and sit with him. Syd asks Muharto some questions about his investigation of the disappearance. Muharto replies that his researches into the AURI archives and interviewing former officers only raised more questions that they answered.
