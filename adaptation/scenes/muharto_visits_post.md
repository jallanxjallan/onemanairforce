The day after the article is published, Muharto visits Jakarta Post to pick up any available extra copies to give to friends colleagues. He thanks Cameron for the story and Sabam for providing the opportunity. Muharto tells Sabam that, when showing to the article to clients, he was appalled to realize that few people had been aware of his friend and his contribution to the nation. Muharto asks Sabam if Cameron could write more stories about RI-002. Sabam is reluctant to agree, saying that Cameron is busy with his copyediting duties. After Muharto leaves, Syd, who has overheard the conversation in the open newsroom, suggests that Sabam accede to the request, noting: "It will keep Cameron busy and out of your hair." Sabam grunts, and then goes over to Cameron and tells him of Muharto's request. Cameron jumps at the chance. Sabam suggests he start with background research in the new national library, recommending a book he had found in the reference section a few weeks before.
