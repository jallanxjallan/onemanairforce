---





Ining writes a letter Major Primitivo asking to be
relieved of his assignment and returned home. He rushes to Maguwo, but
is seconds too late to give it to Muharto to take to Manila. George, on
duty as flight controller, is on the tarmac. He sees that Ining is
upset, so he asks Muharto's brother, Mas Ded, to take Ining back to
Jalan Jetis and stay with him until his calms down.

â€‹           At the end of November,  Ining writes a letter to Primitivo asking to return to the Philippines, but is too late to give it to Muharto for delivery. Ining is clearly distraught, but George must remain at his post. He asks Mas Ded, Muharto's brother, to take Ining home and look after him. The following morning George awakens to the shocking news that both Ining and Mas Ded were found dead in the house on Jalan Jetis.
