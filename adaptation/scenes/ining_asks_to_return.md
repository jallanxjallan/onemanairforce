Ining writes a letter to Primitivo asking to return to the Philippines, but is too late to give it to Muharto for delivery. George, who is airfield supervisor that evening, sees that Ining is distraught. He asks Mas Ded, Muharto's brother, to take Ining home and look after him. The following morning, George hears the shocking news that both Ining and Mas Ded were found dead in the house on Jalan Jetis.
