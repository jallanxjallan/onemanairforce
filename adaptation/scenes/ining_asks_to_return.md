```synopsis
Ining writes a letter Primitivo, asking to be relieved of his assignment and returned home. He rushes to Maguwo, but is seconds too late to put it on RI-002. George, on duty as flight controller, is on the tarmac. He sees that
Ining is upset, so he asks Muharto's
brother, Mas Ded, to take Ining back to Jalan Jetis and stay with him.
