```synopsis
Like these officers, I elected to stay in Jogjakarta, though
I had no intention of surrendering. I had a new bride to pro-
tect. Ironically, Ani had to leap to my own defense the after-
noon of the invasion. Shortly after nightfall Ani and I, along
with many others, were detained by Dutch troops as we passed
through the market on our way home.
     “Oh dear!” I whispered to Ani, “It's a Westerling Sweep.”
      This was bad news indeed. Speaking fluent Dutch, Ani ar-
gued with the sergeant, distracting attention while I surrepti-
tiously chewed and swallowed my Air Force identification papers.
The sergeant told Ani that she was free to go. However, I would
be detained for interrogation. Adopting the imperious attitude
that all high-born Javanese women can summon when neces-
sary, Ani berated the sergeant.
     “Very well,” she said, “but one of you must escort
me home. It is not seemly for a married woman to be
alone on the street at this hour!”
      Trapped between duty and gallantry, the sergeant was sty-
mied. He looked around helplessly. Then, another Dutch soldier
                        WESTERLING SWEEP                           269
    appeared. Dressed in khaki, he wore no insignia, but his confi-
    dent manner, and the deference afforded him by the sergeant and
    troops, left no doubt as to who was in command.
          Fearing an ambush, the presumed officer forbade the troops
    to enter a native area. Ani then demanded to know why I was
    being detained. The officer explained that the khaki pants I wore
    indicated I might be a rebel soldier.
         “The nerve!” Ani retorted. “My husband is wearing
    those ugly things only because they are the only pants avail-
    able in the market. Because of your blockade, we have to
    wear whatever rags we can find!”
          I struggled to keep a grin off my face as the officer endured
    a tongue-lashing from this mere slip of a native girl. Finally, he let
    both of us go, and we hurried home to plan our next move.
