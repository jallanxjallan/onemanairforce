Victor shows Cameron the photo of Robert Koke, and tells of his suspicion that Koke had been "The Quiet American" in Batavia. Cameron ties this in with Boedi's assessment of Tom Lee, and comes to the conclusion that Spoor had been plotting with the newly formed CIA to overthrow the Republic and take control of the East Indies himself, as had happened in South Africa.
