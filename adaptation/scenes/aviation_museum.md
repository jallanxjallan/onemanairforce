Muharto takes Cameron to the Air Force museum, a re-purposed hanger filled with decommissioned aircraft and other exhibits. Muharto points to a model of the Zogling training glider, and tells Cameron of training village boys who had never seen an airplane to become skilled pilots in mere weeks. Grinning, he tells of the time he flew one himself.
