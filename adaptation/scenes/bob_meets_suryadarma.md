Bob Freeberg, a large, fit man in his mid twenties with a pleasant, serious demeanor, pilots a CALI blockade run from Singapore to Jogja. Petit Muharto stands in the cockpit behind Freeberg, staring out the window at the cloud cover below them, broken by the tips of volcanic cones. In the featureless cloudscape, Muharto cannot identify the mountains with any certainty,  

As the aircraft is being unloaded and refueled for the return to
Singapore, Muharto introduces Bob to Suryadarma, who thanks him for his
assistance. Then Suryadarma takes Muharto aside and tells him that this
will be his last blockade run. An Indian businessman has offered to link
India with the Republic with his own Dakota, VT-CLA, and has the full
support of the Indian government. Muharto is both pleased at this
display of crucial international support, and dismayed that once again
he will be desk-bound. However, thanks to Bob, his last flight will be a
memorable one.
