Emeria gives a forceful defense of Hendra Gunawan and his heroic depictions of Indonesian freedom fighters at an exhibition in the Kuntzkrieg. A Dutch onlooker counters that Hendra is obviously a communist, but Emeria shuts him down with the assertion that real artists, like Hendra, are above politics.
