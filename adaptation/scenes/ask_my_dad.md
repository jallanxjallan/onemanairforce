After three hours of reading, Cameron asks Julia where he can get a
coffee. Julia is scheduled for a break herself and escorts Cameron to
the canteen. Julia tells Cameron about her desire to take her post-grad
degree overseas. Cameron, grinning to show he is entirely in jest, says
that she should, because she does not seem to be an Indonesian, as
Indonesians always ask him personal questions like his age and marital
status. Julia replies: "Don't worry, I won't bother you. If I want to
know anything about you I'll just ask my dad". At Cameron's quizzical
look, Julia smiles and explains that her father is a colonel with the
Army's intelligence section, which is known to keep close tabs on the
activities of journalists. Though plainly Julia is teasing Cameron in
return he nonetheless gulps down coffee and says he should get back to
work.
