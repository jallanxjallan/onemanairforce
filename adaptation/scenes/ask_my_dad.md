After two hours of reading, Cameron wants to take a break. Julia suggests he join her for lunch in the canteen. Cameron shows a keen interest in his lunch companion, asking a number of questions. Jullia tells Cameron that, rarely for an Indonesian, she is only only child, and from an early age developed a passion for reading to fill time that would otherwise be taken up looking after siblings. She was recruited for this library position in her senior year, and is now marking time as she applies for scholarships for post-graduate studies overseas. 

Julia then asks Cameron about how he likes living in Indonesia. Cameron
replies that he is adjusting well, except for one annoying habit. Indonesians
ask how old he is, where he is from, and whether he is married.
Cameron says that this is too personal to discuss with some random
stranger. Julia replies that Indonesians consider such inquiries to be
meaningless pleasantries, like "How are you", or "What's new". She then
assures Cameron: Don't worry, I won't bother you. If I want to know
anything about you I'll just ask my dad". At Cameron's quizzical look, Julia smiles and explains that her father
is a colonel with the Army's intelligence section, which is known to keep close tabs on the activities of journalists. Though Julia is plainly
teasing him, Cameron nonetheless gulps down coffee and says he
should get back to work.
