As Cameron drinks his coffee and Julia her tea, Julia asks Cameron about
how he likes living in Indonesia. Cameron replies that he loves it,
except for one annoying habit. Indonesians always ask how old he is,
where he is from, and whether he is married. Cameron says that this is
too personal to discuss with some random stranger. Julia replies that
Indonesians consider such inquiries to be meaningless pleasantries, like
"How are you", or "What's new". She then assures Cameron: Don't worry, I
won't bother you. If I want to know anything I'll just ask my dad\". 

At Cameron's quizzical look, Julia smiles and explains that her father is a general with the  the Army's Intel section. Though Julia is plainly teasing him, Cameron nonetheless gulps down his coffee and says he should get back to work.
