Walter Foote arrives at Spoor's office with a guest, Robert Koke. Julius
Tahija apologizes that Spoor will be busy for a few more minutes and
invites them to wait. Tahija calls out "Nyoman" (a common
name in Bali) to an office boy.  Nyoman enters the room and asks what they would like to drink while they wait.
Koke replies in fluent Balinese. Nyoman is astounded, and Koke explains
that he lived in Bali for many years before the war. Victor is
intrigued, and chats with Koke, who is charming and affable, but
evasive. Julius calls them to enter, Victor follows, camera at the
ready. Spoor waves him away, saying "No photos". Victor clicks the
shutter, coughing to hide the sound, and then leaves.
