Muharto tells Cameron that in May 1948 he was promoted to Major and assigned administrative duties in Air Force headquarters. Thus, he was not able to accompany RI-002 on another crucial mission, carrying President Soekarno, who called Bob "our American friend", on a month-long morale- and fund-raising tour of Republican areas. But they had kept in contact, and Muharto looked forward to Bob attending his wedding on 24 October. Then, on 2 October 1948, Muharto learned that RI-002 had vanished while transporting a ton of Republican gold from Java to Sumatra. Muharto explains that nothing was
known of the crash, and the Dutch authorities denied all knowledge. In
April 1979, Muharto says, farmers searching the remote mountainside for
arable land stumble across aircraft wreckage. Muharto shows Cameron photographs taken by Air Force field investigators.
