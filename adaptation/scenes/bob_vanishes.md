Seven weeks before Bob was to be guest
of honor at Muharto's wedding, RI-002 vanished while transporting a
quarter ton of gold to safety in Bukittinggi. Muharto explains that
nothing was known of the crash, and the Dutch authorities denied all
knowledge. In April 1979, Muharto says, farmers searching the remote
mountainside for new land stumble across the wreckage of an aircraft.
