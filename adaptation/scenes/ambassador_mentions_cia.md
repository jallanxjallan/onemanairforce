```synopsis
Walter Foote arrives at Spoor's office with a guest, Robert Koke. Julius Tahija apologizes that Spoor will be busy for a few more minutes and invites them to wait. Tahija calls out for a steward, "Nyoman", a common name in Bali. Nyoman asks what they would like to drink while they wait. Koke replies in fluent Balinese. Nyoman is astounded, and Koke explained that he lived in Bali for many years before the war. Victor is intrigued, and chats with Koke, who is charming and affable, but evasive. Julius calls them to enter, Victor follows, camera at the ready. Spoor waves him away, saying "No photos". Victor clicks the shutter, coughing to hide the sound, and then leaves.
