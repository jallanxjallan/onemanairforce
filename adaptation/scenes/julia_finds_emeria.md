status: Synopsis

Julia and Cameron go to Jogja with Muharto and Ani to visit parents
graves in honor of 40th anniversary and have a small party with
relatives Julia has found in a Jogja paper about a woman artist living
on the outskirts of Jogja. See contacts the reporter, claiming to be an
arts researcher, and gets the address. Julia goes alone and finds
Emeria. She says she regrets dumping Victor like that, but this was war.
She herself got a "colonial guilt" scholarship and moved to the Hague.
She could still have gotten a scholarship even in her mid-thirties,
especially if she took a few year off her age because she looks young.

She married a Dutch academic who had been one of the voices pushing for
Indonesian independence. She kept a low profile, raising children,
supporting her husband's work, and painting a little on the side. She
and her husband frequently visited Indonesia for conferences etc, but
she did not try to contact Victor. On her husband's death she moved back
to Jogja, where she still has many friends. "This is war. You have to
choose sides"
