Muharto believes that solving the mystery would be a fitting tribute to his lost friend. Cameron sees solving the mystery as his break into real journalism, and offers to help Muharto in his investigation. Muharto is hesitant as he remembers the obstacles he encountered on his first attempt. But Cameron assures Muharto that they now have the resources of the new library, and he knows just the person who can help them.

Syd suggests that the first step would be to learn all he can about the time and place, so Cameron returns to the library. Syd Jardine says that since unloading a quarter ton of gold would
require considerable resources, discovering who might have had the
motivation and ability to transport and sell the gold could solve the
mystery of RI-002. Muharto agrees, and Cameron eagerly offers to help.
He tells Muharto that he knows just the person who could help them do
the research.
