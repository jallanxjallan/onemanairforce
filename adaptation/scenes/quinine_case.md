```treatment
Bob and Muharto attend their first court session to decide who owns Dutch representatives take them to court over possession of the quinine cargo.
```

 Their lawyer,
Salipada Penatun, who is also a sitting senator with extensive
high-level contacts, lays out the legal justification for ownership of
the quinine, then lets Muharto give an impassioned plea, claiming that
the money from selling the quinine will buy medicines and other
essentials unavailable in the besieged capital. The Dutch counter by
calling a plantation expert to testify that the Republic does not have
the capability to process quinine, so the drug must have been produced
in a Dutch-owed factory before the war. Muharto jumps to his feet, ready
to protest this insult to his people's technological skill, but Penatun
motions for him to sit down, then calmly tells the judge: "A foreigner
is not qualified to discuss the internal matters of the sovereign
Republic of Indonesia." The judge considers this, obviously with some
sympathy, and adjourns the session.
