Dutch representatives  sue Muharto and Pang in
civil court for possession of the quinine. Fortunately, Muharto's
celebrity status also attracts the attention of Salipada Penatun, a
sitting Senator as well as a practicing lawyer. His family has close
cultural ties to Indonesia, and so offers his services pro bono. Penatun lays out the legal
justification for ownership of the quinine, then lets Muharto give an
impassioned plea, claiming that the money from selling the quinine will
buy medicines and other essentials unavailable in the besieged capital.
The Dutch counter by calling a plantation expert to testify that the
Republic does not have the capability to process quinine, so the drug
must have been produced in a Dutch-owed factory before the war. Muharto
jumps to his feet, ready to protest this insult to his people's
technological skill, but Penatun motions for him to sit down, then
calmly tells the judge: "A foreigner is not qualified to discuss the
internal matters of the sovereign Republic of Indonesia." The judge
considers this with some sympathy, declines to allow the expert witness,
and adjourns the session.
