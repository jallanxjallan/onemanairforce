Cameron and Julia walk into the lobby together,
where her friends are waiting. Julia introduces Cameron to them, then he
walks toward the bar, while Julia and her friends proceed to the coffee shop. 

Naturally, Julia's friends grill her about Cameron. Julia insists that they have only a professional relationship, research assistant to a journalist. Later, when Julia tries to contribute to the bill, her friends laugh, saying "Honest Eddy's daughter can't afford to pay for her own meal!" If she wants to go overseas, she had better get more friendly with Harley
boy.
