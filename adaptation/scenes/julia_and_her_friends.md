Cameron and Julia realize that they are both headed to the Hotel Hilton -- he to the bar, her to the coffee shop -- to meet friends. Cameron offers her a lift on his Harley. Julia's friends see Cameron drop her off, an assume he is wealthy. Her friends, like Julia the daughters of high military officers, discuss their plans to attend presigious universities in major world capitals, paid for by their fathers' corrupt earnings from side businesses. They joke that since Julia's father, Colonel Eddy, works in the intelligence service, a "dry" posting, hooking up with Cameron is her best chance to study abroad.
