Cameron, an American in his mid 20s, stands at the desk of a middle-aged
Indonesian man in the Jakarta Post newsroom. Cameron
points to a sheet of paper on the desk and lectures the older man in a
condescending manner about mistakes in English grammar. Sabam Siagian, a
distinguished Indonesian middle-aged man wearing a freshly pressed
Safari suit, walks past, seeing the annoyance on the reporter's face.
Cameron sees Sabam and follows him into his office. Inside the cramped
office, Sabam sits at a desk, almost disappearing behind precariously
balanced piles of folders and documents and starts searching for
something. Cameron tries to pitch a story idea, but Sabam waves him off,
reminding the American that he is a foreigner working in a technical
capacity, and not an accredited correspondent. The government is very
strict on this matter, he says. Then Sabam relents, looks through his
papers, and pulls out a card, handing it to Cameron. He explains that
his old friend, Petit Muharto Kartodirdjo, a former Air Force officer,
has an interesting story to tell about an American blockade runner who
mysteriously vanished on 1 October 1948. The coming Saturday will make
the 40-year anniversary of the disappearance. Since this is only a
feature story in a weekend edition about a historical incident, there is
no harm in letting Cameron do the interview. Besides, Sabam continues,
no one else has time to spare.
