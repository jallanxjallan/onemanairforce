```treatment
Cameron Bishop, an American post-grad student on a one-year
internship as an English-language consultant at the The Jakarta Post, stands at the desk of a middle-aged
Indonesian man in the Jakarta Post newsroom. Cameron points to a sheet
of paper on the desk and lectures the older man in a condescending
manner about mistakes in English grammar. Sabam Siagian, a distinguished
Indonesian middle-aged man wearing a freshly pressed Safari suit, walks
past, seeing the annoyance on the reporter's face. Cameron sees Sabam
and follows him into his office. Inside the cramped office, Sabam sits
at a desk, almost disappearing behind precariously balanced piles of
folders and documents and starts searching for something. Cameron tries
to pitch a story idea, but Sabam waves him off, reminding the American
that he is a foreigner working in a technical capacity, and not an
accredited correspondent. The government is very strict on this matter,
he says. Then Sabam relents, looks through his papers, and pulls out a
card, handing it to Cameron. He explains that his old friend, Petit
Muharto Kartodirdjo, a former Air Force officer, has an interesting
story to tell about an American blockade runner who mysteriously
vanished on 1 October 1948. The coming Saturday will make the 40-year
anniversary of the disappearance. Since this is only a feature story in
a weekend edition about a historical incident, there is no harm in
letting Cameron do the interview. Besides, Sabam continues, no one else
has time to spare.
