Cameron Bishop, an well-groomed American in his mid-twenties who displays the intellectual arrogance of an Ivy-league post-grad student, stands at the desk of a middle-aged
Indonesian reporter, his shirt wrinkled and sweaty from a long day on his beat. Cameron points to a sheet
of paper on the desk and lectures the older man in a condescending
manner about his minor mistakes in English grammar. 

Sabam Siagian, a distinguished
middle-aged Indonesian man wearing a freshly pressed Safari suit, walks
past, and notices the annoyance on the reporter's face. Cameron sees Sabam
and follows him into his office. Sabam sits
at a desk  taking up most of the space of the cramped office, almost disappearing behind precariously balanced piles of
folders and documents, and starts searching for something. Cameron tries
to pitch a story idea, but Sabam waves him off, reminding the American
that he is a foreigner working in a technical capacity as an English-language consultant, and not an
accredited correspondent. The government is very strict on this matter, Sabam reminds him. 

Then Sabam relents, looks through his papers, and pulls out a
card, handing it to Cameron. Sabam explains that an long-time friend, Petit
Muharto Kartodirdjo, a former Air Force officer, has an interesting
story to tell about an American blockade runner who mysteriously
vanished on 1 October 1948. The coming Saturday will mark the 40-year
anniversary of the disappearance. Since this is only a feature story in
a weekend edition about a historical incident, there is no harm in
letting Cameron do the interview. Besides, Sabam continues, no one else
has time to spare.
