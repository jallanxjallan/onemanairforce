Muharto explains the mundane but essential mission, and the dangers of evading Dutch patrols.  Muharto tells Cameron that the people of Jogja came to regard the modest and unassuming American as some sort of superhero, an incarnation of a mythic figure from the wayang shadow-play theater.  This often led to embarrassing situations, such as when Bob invited Muharto to dine with him at the Hotel Merdeka, where he stayed while in Jogja.
