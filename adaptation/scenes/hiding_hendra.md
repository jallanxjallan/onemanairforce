A squad of native KNIL soldiers burst into Emeria's studio. Emeria is composed and polite, inviting them to search the cluttered premises. However, she refuses to allow them to enter her private bedroom, as it would be "improper". The squad commander, a Javanese, is intimidated. He thanks Emeria for her cooperation, and they leave. Moments afterward, Hendra emerges from the bedroom.
