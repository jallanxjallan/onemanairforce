In the gathering darkness, Muharto has difficulty identifying landmarks. Tension mounts in the cabin as the fuels gauges slide toward empty. Bob admonishes Muharto saying: "This is your country, you should now where we are!" Muharto draws on the vivid schoolboy memory of his classmates giggling as they describe a range of low, rounded hills near Jogja as female breasts. He soon spots the distinctive geographic feature and, now oriented, guides Bob to a safe landing in Jogja.
