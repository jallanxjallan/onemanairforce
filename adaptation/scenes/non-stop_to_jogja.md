RI-002 flies between the volcanic peaks of Java, which throw ominous
shadows over the land in as the sun sets. Since the presence of Captain
Espina could not be revealed, RI-002 was forced to fly non-stop from
Manila, extending the range with a spare fuel tank installed in the
cargo hold. That was now empty, as well as the wing tanks. Freeberg asks
Muharto to identify landmarks with increasing urgency. Muharto peers out
the window, unsure of what can barely make out in the gathering gloom.
Finally, Freeberg almost shouts: "Dammit Muharto! Where are we? You
should know! This is your country!" A nervous laugh escapes Muharto's
lips, as usual for an embarrassed Javanese person. Muharto looks out the
cockpit window again, and again laughs, this time in delight at a
schoolboy memory. Muharto has spotted a line of low, rounded hills that
he and his school mates called, naturally, the "Susu Seribu", the
Thousand Breasts. With this vivid memory trigger Muharto can clearly
visualize the relevant page in his school atlas. Now with authority in
his voice, he tells Freeberg: "Fly toward those hills, turn to the west
and follow them until the last one, then turn back north and fly for 30
kilometers." A few minutes later, RI-002 lands in Maguwo, the engines
sputtering to a halt as it rolls along the runway.
