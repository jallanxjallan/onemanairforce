Victor's familiarity with photography gains him a plum assignment to the Mapping Dept, where he develops and classifies photographs taken by field surveyors. Several of the Indonesian map makers are amateur artists, and so Victor is invited to accompany them to the exhibitions of Batavia's vibrant arts scene. At an event featuring the flamboyant Dutch artist Auke Sonnega, the artist overhears Victor giving astute criticism of his paintings. He introduces himself and suggests Victor write up some notes and send them, along with the photos, to a friend who works for the *Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad* newspaper. Victor becomes a regular contributor to the paper, covering the arts circuit and doing photographic essays on street life, all while concealing his status as a KNIL recruit.
