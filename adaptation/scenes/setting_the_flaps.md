Bob invites Muharto to sit in co-pilot seat and assist him with the flap controls during the final approach to Manila. But when Bob gives the command, the nervous Muharto pushed the levers to full, causing the Dakota lurch downward. Bob instantly repositions the levers, and gently reminds Muharto to not pass the half-flaps setting until they see the runway.
