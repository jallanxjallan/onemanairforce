During the Soekarno Tour, Bob refuses Soekarno's order to land on what Bob judged to be an unsafe runway. Soekarno insists, saying: "To as I say. I'm the president!" Bob replies, in a measured tone: "Indeed, sir. Down there you are the president. But up here, I'm the captain."

Bob flies low over a town where an important regional leader lives to
determine whether he can land RI-002 safely on an overgrown grass
airstrip. Bob decides not to risk the safety of his passengers, which
infuriates Soekarno. He demands that Bob land on the strip, declaring:
"I'm the president!" Bob replies, pointing downward: "Down there, sir,
indeed you are the president. But up here, I'm the captain."
