title: Muharto Regrets
synopsis: Muharto tells Cameron that if he had flown with Freeberg on that last flight it might not have ended in tragedy. 
---

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob's
remains, could not be buried with the others in the National Hero cemetary because he was a foreigner.
Muharto's expression as he finishes his reminiscences convinces Cameron
that he had regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking closure
about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto
wonders that if he had turned down promotion and had been with Bob on
the final flight, maybe it would not have ended in tragedy.
