Flying to Tasik in a refurbished Japanese aircraft, whose pilot had only first seen an airplane a few months previously, Muharto takes his mind from possible catastrophe by recollecting his experiences during his blockade runs three months previously, wondering which pilot it might be.

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight, Muharto pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it must be Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before when he accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the Manilia-based CALI charter airline.

En route to the location, Muharto remembers the foreign pilots he had commissioned for blockade runs earlier in the year, and decided it must be Bob Freeberg. The other pilots had treated the flights as purely commercial assignments -- the crew had even included a flight attendant, Miss Brown, a comely Filipina. But Bob had been willing to undertake risky tasks on the return leg, including a test land on a jungle air strip and dropping paratroopers into a highland town. Only Bob, Muharto decides, was both the high level of skill and total lack of fear to fly into a hostile environment unannounced and 
to land safely on a remote beach.
