Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit
monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even
seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight,
Muharto says he pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it must be
Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before when he
accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the
Manilia-based CALI charter airline.
