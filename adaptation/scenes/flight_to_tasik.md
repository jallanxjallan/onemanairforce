Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight, Muharto pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it must be Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before when he accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the Manilia-based CALI charter airline.
