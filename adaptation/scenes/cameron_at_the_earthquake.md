Syd invites
Cameron to join him for a few drinks at his favorite bar, the
Earthquake. He introduces Cameron to the owner. Sanyoto, who had been a drill
sergeant in the Air Force, then worked as a fixer for foreign oil
companies until he retired and opened the bar. Sanyoto maintains wide
contacts in the highest levels of government and the military, who all regard him with great respect, so the
Earthquake is popular with generals and cabinet ministers. Sanyoto is delighted to hear of the investigation into the RI-002 mystery, and allows Cameron to interview his guests as long as he minds his manners.
