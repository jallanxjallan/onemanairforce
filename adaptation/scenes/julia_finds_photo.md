While correctly placing a misfiled folder of a Batavia newspaper, Julia finds an article about the disappearance of RI-002 illustrated by a photo of RI-002 seemingly guarded by Dutch soldier. At IPPHOS, Victor searches through the files and finds a shot of a runway with similar hills in the background, labelled: Karangendah, Palembang.
