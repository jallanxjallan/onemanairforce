```synopsis
Julia finds a photo of RI-002 seemingly guarded by Dutch soldier. She shows it to Cameron and Victor, who recognizes the airfield from the survey processed 40 years before. Victor suspects it might be Karangendah, though he is certain the runway, meant for fighters, is too short for a Dakota. But Cameron remembers from the first Muharto interview that Bob had landed successfully on the CALI blockade run.
