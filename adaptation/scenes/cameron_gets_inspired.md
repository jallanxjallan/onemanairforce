Muharto tells Cameron and Syd that he is still disturbed by the inability, or perhaps reluctance, of the retired officers to provide information. Muharto wonders if they know what had happened to the gold. If, as Sulaiman suspected, the crash site had been visited by a military outfit, who would have been capable of extracting the gold, then perhaps the officers did not want to stir up trouble. 

An office boy arrives with a stack of copies for Muharto. He thanks everyone and takes his leave. Cameron tells Syd that, if what Muharto suspects is correct, this is a great story. Syd advises Cameron to not get involved, as who knows where this might lead. But Cameron is adamant, so Syd suggests he invent a cover story. 

â€‹           Tells Syd it would be great book.
Syd says it would be, if it had an ending. Publishers don't like to keep readers hanging. 
So, Cameron says, I'll solve the mystery.

Better keep it quiet. and don't let Sabam find out.

Cameron tells Sabam he has decided to do his grad thesis on the revolution. As he leaves the office, Sabam calls him back, suggesting he start at the National Library new reference section, where he recently read Recruit to Revolution. 

Cameron agrees, and later tells Sabam that he  would like to do more research into the story as a basis for a grad-school paper when he returns home. Sabam wishes him luck, and recommends a book he had found in the reference section of the newly opened National Library a few weeks before. Sabam also reminds Cameron to do this on his own time, and not to involve the Jakarta Post.
