Muharto, Boedi and Pang are sitting in the radio nook, where Boedi is trying to fix the radio. He hears static, and when he pushes the transmit key, there is a loud pop and a wisp of smoke from the unit. He turns to his comrades and joins the hushed discussion about the uncertain reception in Manila. Then they all look to the cockpit, where Bob is at his fourteenth hour at the controls, showing no sign of fatigue. The three turn to look at each other and say, in unison, "Let's do this".
