George Rueneker introduces Cameron to Captain
Jack, a retired pilot who had learned his bush-piloting skills flying with Dave Fowler during the early days of Airfast. During
the hundreds of hours they spent together in the cockpit, Captain Jack
had heard all of Fowler's stories, and is happy to repeat them to
Cameron.
