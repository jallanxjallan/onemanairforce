Julia tells Cameron that, by the tone of the language, the reporter was convinced that Spoor was hiding something. She says they might get more information from Victor de Jong, a Dutch-born, naturalized Indonesian photographer who consults for the museum. Victor had been a Dutch conscript assigned to KNIL headquarters as a photographic assistant analyst.
