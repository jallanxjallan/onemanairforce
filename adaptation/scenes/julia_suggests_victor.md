Julia notes that the snide tone of the language in the article suggests
the reporter was convinced that Spoor was hiding something. She says
they might get more information from Victor de Jong, a Dutch-born,
naturalized Indonesian photographer who consults for the museum. Victor,
Julia explains, had been working in KNIL headquarters as an assistant
photographic technician/analyst and reporting directly to Spoor. She telephones Victor, confirms he is in his office, and, to Cameron's surprise, informs her colleagues that she is leaving early and beckons Cameron to follow her out the door. 

In the parking lot, Julia is nonplussed to see their transportation: a 
Harley Davidson motorcycle. As Cameron expertly weaves the massive, snorting machine through the Jakarta gridlock, she briefly grabs his waist, to her embarrassment.
