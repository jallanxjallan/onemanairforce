``` synopsis
Soekarno Tour props up support for the independence struggle and to
raise money to purchase a presidential aircraft, to be named RI-001.
Bob flies low over a town where an important regional leader lives to determine whether he can land RI-002 safely on an overgrown grass airstrip. Bob decides not to risk the safety of his passengers, which infuriates Soekarno. He demands that Bob land on the strip, declaring: "I'm the president!" Bob replies, in a measured tone and pointing downward: "Down there, sir, indeed you are the president. But up here, I'm the captain."
Soekarno gives a speech near where RI-002 had landed. Soekarno points to
Bob resting in the shade with Boedi under a wing and says: "Here is a
foreigner, but he is on our side."
