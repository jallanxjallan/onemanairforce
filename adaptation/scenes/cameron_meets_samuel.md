The entertainment this evening a keroncong band, playing lilting melodies featuring sentimental Dutch-language lyrics.
Regarded as "music for seniors" the audience of retired
military officers laps it up. Afterward, Sanyoto introduces 
Cameron to Samuel Quiko, the band leader. Sanyoto mentions that Samuel
had been active in the revolution, and might have interesting stories to
tell. Cameron shows little interest in speaking to Samuel and soon drifts away.
