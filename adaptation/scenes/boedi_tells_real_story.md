Cameron visits Boedi again to give him the Affandi sketch. Boedi is
delighted, and points out that any art dealer would buy this signed,
dated drawing by the Indonesian maestro for \$1000, no questions asked.
He praises Cameron for his honesty and offers him a beer. Now more
relaxed, Boedi regales Cameron with further tales of Bob Freeberg and
other foreign pilots, the Aviation Brotherhood.
