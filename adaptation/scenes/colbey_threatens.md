On the evening of  in the ballroom of what used to be the Dutch governor's palace in Bukittinggi, Richard Cobley, a semi-piratical British aviator, drunkenly accuses Bob of taking the best contracts by scaring off others by exaggerating the danger.  Later, while Bob stumbles along an unlit path to his lodgings, Cobley confronts him, warning that an "accident" might happen to his ramshackle Dakota unless he shares the wealth.
