Muharto visits to personally thank Sabam and Cameron for the article, and to tell them that he has been bombarded with calls from old friends asking about what happened to the gold. Syd Jardine says that since unloading a quarter ton of gold would require considerable resources, discovering who might have had the motivation and ability to transport and sell the gold could solve the mystery of RI-002. Muharto agrees, and Cameron eagerly offers to help. Sabam gives his grudging assent, but reminds Cameron that the Jakarta Post cannot be involved, and he must to any research on his own time.
