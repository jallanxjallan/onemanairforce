synopsis: '''George Rueneker is disturbed to see the anger in their faces as Ining yells at the recruits.'''

---

Muharto sees that Ining is isolated living among
the youth militia in the forest. He asks George Rueneker to keep Ining company in
his absence. George witnesses Ining berate the young recruits and sees
the displeasure on their faces. Ining asks George to bring whiskey
whenever his visits. 

â€‹           George visits Ining, bringing, as requested, a bottle of local spirits. He witnesses Ining berate the young recruits and sees the displeasure on their faces. Later, as he drinks his arak, Ining complains about the isolation and lack of entertainment options. He had spent the entire war living in the forests of Mindinao, and feels he now deserves a soft desk job.
