George visits Ining, and is disturbed to see the anger in their faces as Ining yells at
the recruits. Ining is obviously unhappy at being isolated among these foreign youths, none of whom can speak English. As requested, George brings a bottle of whiskey obtained from a blockade runner. As he drinks, Ining complains about the isolation and lack of entertainment options. He had spent the entire war living in the forests of Mindinao, and feels he now deserves a soft desk job.
