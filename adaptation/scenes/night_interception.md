While flying a group of international journalists to Jogja under cover of darkness, Fowler believes he spots Dutch fighters flanking him. His radio operator, a Dutch-speaking Indonesian monitoring military frequencies, hears fighter pilots asking for instructions during an intercept, thought his cannot pin down their location. The response is the disengage, as "there are civilians on board". Looking out his left-hand window, Fowler clearly sees the silhouette of a fighter, wings almost vertical as it banks away.
