On the evening of Bob Freeberg lands his unmarked Dakota cargo plane on remote Cilotok beach in southwest Java, the
huge aircraft shuddering to a stop a few meters from a cliff at one end.
Villagers appear, marveling at this colossus from the sky. They are
friendly and offer Bob and his two Filipino crew members food and a
place to sleep. But the following morning, Indonesian soldiers appear.
One points to the lack of registration on the Dakotas tail and shouts
"*Mata-Mata*!", "Spy!" They point their rifles directly at Bob. He
replies with the only words they might understand, a name: "Captain
Petit Muharto"
