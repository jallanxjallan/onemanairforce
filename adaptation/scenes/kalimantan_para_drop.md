Bob and Boedi fly ten paratroopers to be dropped near an insurgent stronghold in the forests of Kalimantan. None have jumped before, so tension is high. There is an uproar as the parachute of one trooper opens and dumps onto the cabin floor. The trooper swears it was an accident, but all others accuse him of cowardice. The troopers look at each other, wondering if any one will be next. Boedi enters the cabin. Though he is only an airman, the charismatic Boedi takes command of the situation, assuring the troopers that Bob has much wartime experience flying paratroopers and will drop them safely. He goes to the cockpit, talks with Bob for a moment, then tells each trooper to approach the cockpit and shake Bob's hand. They do so, and are emboldened by Bob's air of quiet competance. The dropmaster issues the command to jump, and the cabin empties, save for the dropmaster and a lone recruit wondering what fate is in store for him back at Maguwo. Boedi watches as the parachutes drift down and are
enveloped by the endless forest.
