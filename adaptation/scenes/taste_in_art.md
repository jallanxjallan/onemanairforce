At the end of the interview, Cameron compliments Boedi on his taste in
art, particularly the sweeping, vibrant expressionist works covering
much of the wall space in the living room. Boedi is pleased that the
American appreciates Indonesian art. He says that he is great friends
with the artist, Affandi, and suggests Cameron visit Affandi's museum if
he visits Jogjakarta. Muharto tells Cameron that he is planning to go to
Jogja to visit his spiritual advisor, and so they should go together so
he can also visit the Aviation Museum there, where items of RI-002
wreckage are stored.
