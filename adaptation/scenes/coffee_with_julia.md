Cameron, exhausted after hours of reading, asks Julia where he can get some coffee. Julia informs him that beverages are not allowed in the reading room, but since she is also due for a break, he can join her in the library canteen. Over coffee, she tells of her childhood in the Netherlands, where her father had been a military diplomat, her frustrations living in conservative, parochial Indonesia, and her dream of taking her post-graduate studies in America. 

Cameron attempts, in turn, to tell of his ambition to 
become an international investigative journalist, to be free to write
follow his own leads and write bestselling books. But Julia stops him,
saying, with a mischievous smile, that if she wants to know anything
about him she will simply ask her father, who is a senior officer in
military intelligence. Cameron looks around
involuntarily, puts down his coffee and tells Julia it is time for him to get back to work.
