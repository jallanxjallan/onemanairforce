After hours of research, Cameron asks Julia where he can get a cup of coffee.
Julia invites him to join her at the library canteen. Julia tells
Cameron of her dream of securing a scholarship to pursue post-graduate
studies in America. Cameron attempts, in turn, to tell of his dreams of
becoming an international investigative journalist. But Julia stops him,
saying, with a mischievious smile, that if she wants to know anything
about him she will simply ask her father, who is a senior officer in military
intelligence.
