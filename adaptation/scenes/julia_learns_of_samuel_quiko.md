Cameron
mentions his meeting with Samuel Quiko to Julia. She remarks on distinctive
name, indicating a Portuguese heritage, and remembers seeing it in a
review of a musical performance in 1947. Julia disappears into the stacks,
reappearing with an armful of magazines containing articles about
keroncong. In a couple of photos Samuel is with
Emeria. Julia suggests that they interview Samuel Quiko. Cameron demurs,
saying that a guy who plays "music for seniors" would be of little value
in investigating the fate of RI-002. Julia shoots Cameron a contemptuous glance, and peruses the articles for a listing of Samuel's contact information.
