Cameron meets Boediardjo again to give him the sketch from Affandi. Boedi laughs and says Affandi was must have been testing his character as he could have sold this, a signed Affandi for hundreds of dollars. Boedi invites Cameron to stay for a beer, and asks about the progress of his investigations. Cameron replies that every new discovery raises a host of questions. Boedi says that he is not surprised, as Muharto is not telling him everything.
