``` synopsis
Cameron takes Julia to an expat party in Kemang,
and she is mistaken for a bar girl. Later, when they are alone by the pool, 
Julia goes ballistic, saying Cameron is just like the other bules, believing that Indonesia, and Indonesians, are just here to be exploited for pleasure or profit.
