Julia and Cameron enter the IPPHOS office, located
on the ground floor of a building in the colonial-era section of
Jakarta. The building is one municipal inspection away from being
condemned. An ancient air conditioner wheezes over a window, having no
discernible effect on the heat and humidity. The office has a single
occupant: Victor, a slight, elderly man of sallow complexion, who is the
only person in the office and openly delighted at receiving company.

Julia introduces Cameron and explains the purpose of their visit. The
negatives and prints of the collection are stored in tattered folders
placed seemingly at random, but Victor strides confidently to a shelf,
pulls out a folder from the middle of a pile, and brings it back to the
desk. He leafs through the folder and pulls out a strip of negatives
showing a large American standing in front of an airplane. It is Bob
Freeberg and RI-002. Victor repeats the process and shows Cameron images
of Spoor in his office. Victor explains that his desk was located in the
hallway outside Spoor's office, and on many occasion overheared Spoor
raging about the foreign pilots running the Dutch blockade with
impunity.
