Cameron and Julia visit Victor at the Indonesian Photo Agency, or IPPHOS, which he manages. Victor  illustrates his recollections of the time by finding and showing news photographs from 1947 and 1988. Candid shots of Spoor convey his frustration and fury at reports of RI-002 evading his blockade with impunity, and his bemusement to learn that a Republican aircraft that had crashed on a beach in Malaya was not smuggling guns, but common household wares.
