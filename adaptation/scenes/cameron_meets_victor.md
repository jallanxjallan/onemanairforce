---
Julia and Cameron enter the IPPHOS office, located
on the ground floor of a building in the colonial-era section of
Jakarta. The building is one municipal inspection away from being
condemned. An ancient air conditioner wheezes over a window, having no
discernible effect on the heat and humidity. The office has a single
occupant: Victor, a slight, elderly man of sallow complexion who is openly delighted at receiving company.

Julia introduces Cameron and explains the purpose of their visit. The
negatives and prints of the collection are stored in tattered folders
placed seemingly at random, but Victor strides confidently to a shelf,
pulls out a folder from the middle of a pile, and brings it back to the
desk. He leafs through the folder and pulls out a strip of negatives
showing a large American and much-smaller Indonesian resting on the grass in the shade of an aircraft wing. It is Bob
Freeberg and Boediardjo taking a break. Victor repeats the process and shows Cameron more images, each bringing the time and place into vivid visual clarity.

Victor shows a photo of Spoor in his office, reading reports with a sour expression. Victor explains that his desk was located in the
hallway outside Spoor's office, and on many occasion overheard Spoor
raging about the foreign pilots running the Dutch blockade with
impunity.
