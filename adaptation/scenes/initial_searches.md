Muharto tells Cameron that on the afternoon of 1 October 1948 he heard
reports that RI-002 had not arrived at Bukittinggi. In the following
days, the Dutch denied any knowledge of the disappearance, and the
Republic was unable to mount more than a cursory search. 

Muharto tells Cameron that the wreckage of RI-002 was discovered in April 1977 on a remote mountain. He shows Cameron a newspaper report that that no gold was found, only a few skeletal fragments.
