Suryadarma tells Muharto that this will be his last blockade run. An Indian businessman has offered to link India with the Republic with his own Dakota, registered as VT-CLA. He has the full support of the Indian government, so further chartered runs will not be necessary. Muharto is disappointed, but this will be memorable, as Suryadarma asks Bob to make a couple of detours on the way back to Singapore. Bob cheerfully agrees.
