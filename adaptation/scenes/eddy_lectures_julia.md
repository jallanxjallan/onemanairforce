Eddy opposes Julia marrying a foreigner. Eddy has checked into Cameron's background, and found he is penniless and with a spotty academic record, though he excelled in journalism and seems to be a good writer. Eddy promises to fulfill her dream of studying overseas. Julia says you don't have the money. Eddy replies that he is making arrangements. Julia says ok, as long as one of the arrangements is not marriage.
