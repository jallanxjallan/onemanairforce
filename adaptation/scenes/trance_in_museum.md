Muharto takes Cameron to the Air Force museum in Jogja, a re-purposed
hanger filled with decommissioned aircraft and other exhibits. Muharto
points to a model of the Zogling training glider, and tells Cameron of
training training village boys who had never seen an airplane to become
skilled pilots in mere weeks. Muharto seeks out the curator, who invites
them into his office. Muharto asks the curator to retrieve scraps from
the RI-002 wreckage stored at the museum. One of the items is the dynamo
with the bullet inexplicably lodged in the windings. Muharto picks it
up, and from his point of view, the room around him fades into mist. The
room comes back into focus, and Muharto sees the concerned faces of
Cameron and the curator. Muharto places the dynamo back into the storage
box and says, in a wavering voice, that they will miss their train back
to Jakarta if they don't hurry.
