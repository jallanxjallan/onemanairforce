Muharto visits to thank Cameron personally and pick up more copies to give to those who also knew Freeberg. Muharto remarks that, beside praising Freeberg and his contribution to the nation, all of his friends wondered about the fate of the gold. Muharto admits that soon after the discovery of the RI-002 wreckage he attempted to investigate further, but with little success.
