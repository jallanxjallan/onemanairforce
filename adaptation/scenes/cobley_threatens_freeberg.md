As Freeberg enters, the pilots raise their glasses and hail "Fearless Freeberg". Though the "salute" is plainly in jest, there is nonetheless real respect for the most skilled and courageous of their brotherhood. One pilot, however, is envious of how Freeberg seems to monopolize contracts with the Republic. British aviator Ralph Cobley openly threatens to harm Freeberg if he does not "share the weath".
