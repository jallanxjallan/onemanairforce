Sabam strides into the
newsroom, brandishing a copy of the paper, and approaches a disheveled,
chain-smoking older American sitting at the desk adjacent to Cameron.
Sabam points to an article headlined "Ladyboy Molested By Sex-Crazed
Gang", and says: "This is a family newspaper!". 

Sabam then turns to
Cameron, still holding the paper, and points to another page with a
photo of Bob Freeberg. He says that Muharto was delighted with the
article. Cameron agrees that was an intriguing story, and says he would
like to do some follow-up research. Sabam nods in agreement, saying "On
your own time, of course" and suggests he start with a book he had
recently stumbled across in the reference section of the new national
library. He writes the name of the book in the margin of the paper in
his hand, leaves it on Cameron's desk, and returns to his office.

Cameron picks of a copy of the newspaper on his desk, turns a page, and
reads aloud: "And then the rapists took their turns to quench their
unnatural desires with the body of the hapless transvestite
hairdresser." The article carries the byline: "Our Reporter". Cameron
asks the American, Syd, how he gets away with it. Syd replies that he
and Sabam go way back. Sabam's biggest worry is that Cameron or another
foreign copy editors are not sufficiently familiar with the fine points
of Indonesian culture and history, and will let something slip through
that will rile some high official. Sabam relies on Syd as the last pair
of eyes before it all goes to press. 

"Doing proper journalism in
Indonesia is like walking a tightrope," Syd says, "and I'm the safety
net." Syd then turns away and takes a metal flask from his desk drawer.
There is a slight tremor in his hand as he pours a splash from the flask
into his coffee, replaces the flask in his desk, and goes back to work.
