Victor searches the hundreds of thousands of images in the archives, looking for more photos that will spark his memory of the time. He stops when he comes across a photo of a strikingly beautiful Indonesian woman in her late twenties who, though dressed in baggy, paint-splattered overalls, radiates elegance and poise. The caption reads "Emeria Soenassa in her studio, 1948". Julia asks Victor who she is. Victor replies "No one important", snatches the photo from the table and files it away.
