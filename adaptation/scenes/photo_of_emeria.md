Victor searches for more shots of Batavia to prod his memory about Spoor's efforts to stop the blockade runs. He stops when he comes across a photo of a strikingly beautiful Indonesian woman who radiates elegance and poise even dressed in paint-splattered overalls. The caption reads "Emeria Soenassa in her studio 1948". Julia asks
Victor who she is. Victor replies "No one important", snatches the photo
from the table and files it away.
