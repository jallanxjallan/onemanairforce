Julia is having dinner 
with Eric, a well-dressed, well-groomed young Indonesian man. Eric mentions his
surprise Julia's mother phoned his mother to suggest he take her to
dinner. Eric dominates the conversation, insisting, with the
authoritative confidence typical of the offspring of new wealth, how he
is an essential component in the business deal that their respective
fathers are cooking up. Julia wants more details about this "business
deal", but decides it would be better to remain silent.
