Julia is sitting in a restaurant
with Eric, a young Indonesian man of good family. Eric mentions his
surprise Julia's mother phoned his mother to suggest he take her to
dinner. Eric dominates the conversation, insisting, with the
authoritative confidence typical of the offspring of new wealth, how he
