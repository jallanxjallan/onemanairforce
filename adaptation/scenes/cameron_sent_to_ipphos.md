Cameron sits at his desk, making final corrections on a paper copy of his article. Sabam emerges from his office, waving a copy of the Jakarta Post
newspaper, ands strides into the newsroom. Cameron stands up to give the article draft to Sabam, but the editor ignores him and goes to the adjacent desk of  Syd Jardine, a disheveled,
chain-smoking, older American. Sabam slams the newspaper on his desk,
points to an article entitled "Ladyboy Molested By Sex-Crazed Gang",
with the byline: "Our Reporter" and shouts: "This is a family
newspaper!".

As Sabam turns, Cameron gives Sabam the sheets of paper. He scans the first page, grunts, gives the sheets to Syd  carries them back to his office. As Syd reads the draft, Cameron reaches over from his adjacent desk, takes the paper, chuckles,
and says "This is your best yet. Where did you get it?" Syd replies: "A
becak driver showed it to me as he drove me back from the bar. We had a good laugh about it. If you
really want to understand a people, read the tabloids."

Syd finishes reading the piece, and says it needs a photo of Freeberg himself, not just the generic photos of AURI aircraft that Muharto gave him. Syd suggests that Cameron try the Indonesian Photo Agency, IPPHOS, who have an extensive collection of images from the period. An elderly Dutch-born photojournalist, Victor, looks after the place. "He will find one", Syd says. "He has, literally, a 'photographic memory'".

, hands them back to Cameron, and tells him that the piece needs more background, suggesting he go to the library and read a book he had discovered in the reference section: *Recruit to Revolution*

Cameron finishes the draft of his article as Sabam, wearing an expensive batik shirt suitable for a formal event, strides into the newsroom. He stops at Syd's desk to ask a question. Cameron takes this opportunity to give Sabam the rewrite. Sabam looks at it, grunts, and hands it to Syd. He then turns and strides out the door, followed by his driver carrying Sabam's briefcase. 


Cameron writes up the interview, and gives it to Sabam. However, Sabam is on his way to a diplomatic dinner, and simply hands the pages to Syd, an American  retired foreign correspondent who works as senior copy editor, and rushes out the door. Syd reads the piece, and suggests that Cameron corroborate 
Muharto's story with newspaper and other reports, which he can find at the newly opened National Library. 

In the Jakarta Post newsroom, Cameron finishes the first draft of the
Muharto interview, then hands it to Syd Jardine, a disheveled,
chain-smoking, older American sitting at the adjacent desk. After
reading it, Syd tells Cameron that the article is good, but a bit thin,
and needs more context to be understandable to the Post's foreign
readership. Syd suggests Cameron go to the national library and read the
book *Recruit to Revolution*, which has a chapter on Freeberg, and all
the historical background Cameron needs.



says it is an "important piece of Indonesian history." However, he noticed that, bases on his own extensive readings of the period, Muharto has misremembered some historical events. Syd  
suggests that Cameron fact-check the piece by reading contemporaneous newspaper accounts available in the newly opened national library. Syd tells Cameron that a friend of his, Victor, a Dutch national turned Indonesian who was noted journalist in the Soekarno era, is in the archives section most most mornings. He would be happy to give Cameron a hand.
