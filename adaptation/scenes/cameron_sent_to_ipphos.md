Cameron sits at his desk, making final corrections on a paper copy of his article. Sabam strides from his office into the newsroom, waving a copy of the Jakarta Post newspaper, and approaches Cameron, who takes the papers to hand to Sabam. But the managing editor ignores him and instead turn to the adjacent desk, where sits Syd Jardine, a  disheveled,
chain-smoking, older American. Sabam slams the newspaper on his desk, points to an article  "Ladyboy
Molested By Sex-Crazed Gang", with the byline: "Our Reporter" and shouts: "This is a family newspaper!".	

Sabam turns, and Cameron thrusts the papers into his hands. Sabam grunts, takes a brief glance, and hands them to Syd and strides back to his office. Syd reads the piece, and asks Cameron if he has photographs. Cameron shows him photographs of RI-002 that Muharto had copied from AURI archives. Syd says the piece should be illustrated with a photo of Freeberg himself. He suggests Cameron to go to the Indonesian Photo Agency, IPPHOS, who have an extensive collection of images from the period. He says a Dutch-born photojournalist, Victor, looks after the place. "He will find one", Syd says. "He has, literally, a 'photographic memory'".

, hands them back to Cameron, and tells him that the piece needs more background, suggesting he go to the library and read a book he had discovered in the reference section: *Recruit to Revolution*

Cameron finishes the draft of his article as Sabam, wearing an expensive batik shirt suitable for a formal event, strides into the newsroom. He stops at Syd's desk to ask a question. Cameron takes this opportunity to give Sabam the rewrite. Sabam looks at it, grunts, and hands it to Syd. He then turns and strides out the door, followed by his driver carrying Sabam's briefcase. 


Cameron writes up the interview, and gives it to Sabam. However, Sabam is on his way to a diplomatic dinner, and simply hands the pages to Syd, an American  retired foreign correspondent who works as senior copy editor, and rushes out the door. Syd reads the piece, and suggests that Cameron corroborate 
Muharto's story with newspaper and other reports, which he can find at the newly opened National Library. 

In the Jakarta Post newsroom, Cameron finishes the first draft of the
Muharto interview, then hands it to Syd Jardine, a disheveled,
chain-smoking, older American sitting at the adjacent desk. After
reading it, Syd tells Cameron that the article is good, but a bit thin,
and needs more context to be understandable to the Post's foreign
readership. Syd suggests Cameron go to the national library and read the
book *Recruit to Revolution*, which has a chapter on Freeberg, and all
the historical background Cameron needs.



says it is an "important piece of Indonesian history." However, he noticed that, bases on his own extensive readings of the period, Muharto has misremembered some historical events. Syd  
suggests that Cameron fact-check the piece by reading contemporaneous newspaper accounts available in the newly opened national library. Syd tells Cameron that a friend of his, Victor, a Dutch national turned Indonesian who was noted journalist in the Soekarno era, is in the archives section most most mornings. He would be happy to give Cameron a hand.
