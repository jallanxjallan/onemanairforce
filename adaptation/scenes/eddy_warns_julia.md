Colonel Eddie has a heart-to-heart talk with Julia about getting into a relationship with a foreigner. 

for relationships about her future. Julia is aware that her father knows about Cameron, but neither  

dances around the subject with such allusion and obfuscation that Julia also does not mention him. Nevertheless, Eddy does state, directly, that since Julia is his only child, he will do anything for her, including sending her off to school in a foreign land, it that is what she truly wishes.
