Colonel Eddie invites Julia for a  heart-to-heart talk about her future. Julia is instantly aware that her father knows about Cameron, but he dances around the subject with such allusion and obfuscation that Julia also does not mention him. Nevertheless, Eddy does state, directly, that since Julia is his only child, he will do anything for her, including sending her off to school in a foreign land, it that is what she truly wishes.
