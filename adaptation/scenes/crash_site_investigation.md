Two wiry men dressed in shabby clothes lead a squad of airmen
and their officer, Lt. Sulaiman, through a forested hillside to the
wreckage of RI-002. The airmen set up camp and search the area. They
find fragments of a wing with the faded letters: RI-00, other airplane
parts, including a dynamo with a bullet wedged between the windings and
armature. They also find
two empty wooden crates labeled with name of a gold mine in Java, but a
thorough search of the area does not find any trace of the gold itself. The airmen dig through the earth around the wreckage, finding unidentifiable fragments of human remains. With great reverence, they clean the soil from the remains, wrap them in clean, white cloth and place them in a backpack. Sulaiman takes a last look around the site, then orders his men to pack up and leave, taking with them the remains and pieces of wreckage small enough to carry.

Sulaiman finds evidence that a sizable group
had set up a field camp as they had done. They had been here recently,
Sulaiman assumes, as the rapid vegetation growth in this tropical rain
forest would have obliterated all signs of their presence in a few
months.

Two farmers lead the investigation team to the wreckage on the rugged
mountain slope. The team finds fragments of a wing with the faded
letters: RI-00, and rusted airplane parts, including a dynamo, part of
the radio set, with a bullet wedged between the windings and armature.

There are a few fragments of human remains, which the soldiers
reverently dig from the earth and wrap in cloth. They also find two
empty wooden crates labeled with the name of a gold mine in Java, but a
