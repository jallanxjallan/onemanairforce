```treatment
An Air Force team investigating the crash site find a few human remains, confirmation that it was RI-002, but no sign of the gold cargo. 
```



Two farmers lead the investigation team to the wreckage on the rugged mountain slope. The team finds fragments
of a wing with the faded letters: RI-00, and rusted airplane parts, including
a dynamo, part of the radio set, with a bullet wedged between the windings and armature. 

There
are a few fragments of human remains, which the soldiers reverently dig
from the earth and wrap in cloth. They also find two empty
wooden crates labeled with the name of a gold mine in Java, but a thorough search of the area does not
find any trace of the gold itself. However, Sulaiman, the team leader, notes evident that a sizable group had set up a field camp as they had done. They had been here recently, Sulaiman assumes, as the rapid vegetation growth in this tropical rain forest would have obliterated all signs of their presence in a few months.  Two wiry men dressed in shabby clothes lead a squad of airmen and their
officer, Lt. Sulaiman, through a forested hillside to the wreckage of
RI-002. The airmen set up camp and search the area. They find fragments
of a wing with the faded letters: RI-00, other airplane parts, including
a dynamo with a bullet wedged between the windings and armature. There
are a few fragments of human remains, which the soldiers reverently dig
from the earth and carefully wrap in cloth. The also find two empty
wooden crates labeled: "Gold", but a through search of the area does not
find any trace of the metal itself.
