Bob invites Muharto and Boedi to his apartment for dinner and drinks to celebrate their victory in court and plan their next moves. Bob says that he and a partner in Singapore are setting up Southeastern airlines. With two more aircraft, Bob can set up scheduled blockade runs between Manila, Bangkok and Jogja, like a regular airline. Boedi turns on Bob's shortwave radio and searches for news broadcasts from the Indies. Then they listen in horror  to reports that VT-CLA, an Indian-registered Dakota that had made many blockade runs, had been shot down on
approach to Maguwo. Muharto turns to Bob and asks if he is still willing
to aid the Republic by flying through the blockade at the risk of being
shot down. Bob nods.
