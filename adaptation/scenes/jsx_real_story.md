In his office, Cameron tells Sabam that this might be an interesting
story, and might be a suitable subject for his master's thesis. He asks
Sabam's permission to use the Jakarta Post credentials to interview
prominent people who might be able to fill in details. Sabam agrees,
reluctantly, and admonishes Cameron to keep to questions to historical
events, and to not touch any subject that might be considered current
news. In return, Sabam tells Cameron to prepare a series of articles
about the coming capital market deregulation which will be run, without
a byline, as background. Cameron nods in agreement, thinking this a fair
arrangement. Back at his desk, tells Syd of his assignment, and, in a
sardonic voice, if he can write articles that are "boring" enough to be
financial reporting. Syd lights a cigarette, takes his flask of whiskey
from the desk drawer, pours a splash into his coffee, and then into the
coffee cup on Cameron's desk, and says: "This whole deregulation thing
will be anything but boring. Let me tell you about what's really
happening with the stock market."
