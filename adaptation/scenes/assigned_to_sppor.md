A young Victor dressed the the fatigues of a KNIL private sorts photographs at a table outside of the office of General Simon Spoor. Through the open door, Victor hears Spoor's voice rise in frustration as he is briefed about daily blockade runs of a Dakota marked with the fictional designation RI-002, and piloted by a free-booting American named Bob Freeberg.
