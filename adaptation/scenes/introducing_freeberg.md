Cameron meets Petit Muharto at his cozy, tidy residence in a Jakarta
suburb. Muharto tells Cameron that he had been the co-pilot of RI-002, a
cargo plane chartered by the Indonesian Air Force to run the blockade
around the Republican territories set up by the Dutch. Muharto starts
his story with the account of a surprise telephone call he received at
his desk at Indonesian air force headquarters in Jogjakarta.
