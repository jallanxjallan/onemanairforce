Petit Muharto sits at his desk. An airman approaches his desk and speaks (without saluting first) that he someone wants to speak to him on the telephone. Muharto looks surprised, stands and walks to a neighboring office, where the only telephone in the building is kept. He listens intently, discerning only a few words through the crackle of static: “Tasikmalaya base”, “Foreign pilot”, “Captain Petit Muharto”. 

Muharto walks to another building, to the office of Suryadarma, the commander of the Air Force. Muharto explains that an officer at the Tasik army base had reported an unknown cargo plane making an emergency landing on a nearby beach, and that the foreign pilot had spoken his name. Suryadarma grins, saying: "Must be
one of your foreign flyboy friends", and sends Muharto to Tasik to
investigate. 

Muharto flies to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit
monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even
seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight,
Muharto ponders who the American pilot might be, and decides it must be
Bob Freeberg. He remembers meeting Freeberg two months before when he
accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the
Manilia-based CALI charter airline.
