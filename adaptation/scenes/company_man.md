conversation onto a neutral subject, but Tom presses the inquiry, and
Muharto obliges with more detailed info. After the dinner, Muharto tells
Boedi that he is pleased the Tom has such an interest in our struggle.
He also says he is guilty about accepting such generosity from the
American, and hopes that when the quinine his sold he can treat Tom to
dinner. Boedi just smiles.
