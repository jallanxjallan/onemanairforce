``` synopsis
Cameron uses his Jakarta Post credentials to gain access to Julius Tahija. He asks some perfunctory questions about foreign investment, then changes the subject to the revolution, and the time Tahija worked for Spoor. Tahija is surprised at the question, but revels in the opportunity to relive those exciting times. Cameron mentions Victor. Tahija grins, and tells Cameron that Victor had been a "Useful Idiot", an intellgence asset to keep tabs on the Indonesian painters, who were all Republicans, and many were communists.

Julius tells Cameron that if he wants to solve the mystery, go to Palembang, check out the airstrip with the help of Anwar Congo, the local preman. Cameron is taken aback. Julius explains the Anwar was the local jago, running the dock laborers in the 60s and 70s. Julius says: You have to deal with all sorts of people running a business in Indonesia.
