Cameron visits the library and 
meets Julia. He discovers that Syd is correct, Julia brings him exactly what he requires from the restricted rare books section. He is not allowed to take the books with him, so he reads and takes notes all morning. He is not allowed to bring liquids into the reading room, so Julia takes Cameron to the library canteen for coffee. Julia tells Cameron about her desire to take her post graduate degree in Europe or American. In return, Cameron attempts to tell Julia about his background, but Julia cuts him off, saying, with a mischievous grin, that she can learn all about him from her father, a general in military intelligence.     

Cameron visits the National Library. Using his Jakarta Post credentials,
he is admitted to the limited-access reference section, an archive of
publications and books dating back to colonial times. He is greeted, in
fluent English, by Julia, an attractive, bookish Indonesian woman in her
early twenties. Julia finds the sole copy of *Recruit to Revolution*,
which, like all items in the collection, cannot be taken from the
premises. Cameron settles down to read the book and take copious notes
of the historical background of the struggle as seen through the eyes of
the author.

At the library, Julia, a grad student working in the reference section,
retrieves the book for Cameron. He is not allowed to take the book from
the reading room, and so stays for several hours, making copious notes
of the historical background of the struggle as seen through the eyes of
the author.

Because Julia has the best English of the staff, she is also informally
the person delegated to attending to foreign visitors. Julia finds the
sole copy of Recruit to Revolution, reminds Cameron to be careful not to
rip the pages of the volume, which is starting to deteriorate.
