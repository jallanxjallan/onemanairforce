Cameron uses his Jakarta Post credentials to enter the reference section. Julia Suryakusuma, the only staffer speaking fluent English, is assigned to fetch the material he needs from the stacks. Julia returns with an armload of books, and Cameron begins reading. Skimming through the supplementary background material Julia selected, Cameron's attention is drawn to a passage in a book by British diplomat John Coast about meeting Bob in Bukittinggi.
