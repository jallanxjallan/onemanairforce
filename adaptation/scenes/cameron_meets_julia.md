At the library, Julia, a grad student working in the reference section, retrieves the book for Cameron. He is not allowed to take the book from the reading room, and so stays for several hours, making copious notes of the historical background of the struggle as seen through the eyes of the author.  He asks Julia where he can get some coffee. No liquids are allowed the reading room, so Julia says she was just about to take a break herself, and invites Cameron to join her in the canteen.
