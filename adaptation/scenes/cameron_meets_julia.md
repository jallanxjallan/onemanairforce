``` {.synopsis}
At the National Libary, Cameron is assisted by Julia, a bookish, attractive final-year student assigned to deal with foreign researchers because of her fluent English.   
```

Cameron visits the National Library. Using his Jakarta Post credentials,
he is admitted to the limited-access reference section, an archive of
publications and books dating back to colonial times. He is greeted, in
fluent English, by Julia, an attractive, bookish Indonesian woman in her
early twenties. Julia finds the sole copy of *Recruit to Revolution*,
which, like all items in the collection, cannot be taken from the
premises. Cameron settles down to read the book and take copious notes
of the historical background of the struggle as seen through the eyes of
the author.

At the library, Julia, a grad student working in the reference section,
retrieves the book for Cameron. He is not allowed to take the book from
the reading room, and so stays for several hours, making copious notes
of the historical background of the struggle as seen through the eyes of
the author.

Because Julia has the best English of the staff, she is also informally
the person delegated to attending to foreign visitors. Julia finds the
sole copy of Recruit to Revolution, reminds Cameron to be careful not to
rip the pages of the volume, which is starting to deteriorate.
