Samuel and
his band play for a social event. During a break, Auke Sonnega gives Samuel a glass of iced genever wrapped in a napkin. Concealed in the napkin is a message to be passed to Republican operatives. On the way to the kampung house to meet the contact, Samuel and his band are
stopped by a Dutch patrol. They immediately break into an impromptu
concert of Dutch-language *Stamboel* songs to show they are only harmless musicians returning from a society event. The soldiers grin and let them pass.
