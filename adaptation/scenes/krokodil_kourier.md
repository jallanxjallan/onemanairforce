Samuel and his band play at an exhibition at the Kuntskring. In between sets, Samuel chats with Auke Sonnega, who surreptitiously hands him a small package. Walking back to their lodgings after the event they are stopped by a Dutch patrol. Samuel tells them
they are musicians returning from a society gathering, and as proof they
take out their guitars and break into a Dutch-language Stamboel song.
The soldiers grin and let him pass.

They continue walking to the house in a "native" neighborhood where they
will spend the night. Samuel gives the package to a preman who will smuggle it across the demarcation line to Jogja.
