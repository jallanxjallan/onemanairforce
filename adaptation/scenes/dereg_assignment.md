```treatment
Syd complains about the quality of the financial articles produced by the JP reporters in the run up to capital market deregulation. Sabam assigns Cameron to interview foreign financial experts and write uncredited background articles. 
```

Cameron tells Sabam that this might be an interesting story, and might be a suitable subject for his master's thesis. He asks Sabam's permission to use the Jakarta Post credentials to interview prominent people who might be able to fill in details. Sabam agrees, reluctantly, and admonishes Cameron to keep to questions to historical events, and to not touch any subject that might be considered current news. 

Back at his desk, Cameron tells Syd of his suspicion that CIA was here right at the the beginning. Syd lights a cigarette, takes his flask of whiskey from the desk drawer, pours a splash into his coffee, and then into the coffee cup on Cameron's desk, and says: “You have no idea...” 

Sabam asks Cameron to prepare a series of articles about the coming
capital market deregulation which will be run, without a byline, as
background. He will be allowed to use JP credentials interview
foreigners only for these articles.

Cameron tells Syd of his assignment, and, in a sardonic voice, asks if
he can write articles that are “boring” enough to be financial
reporting. Syd lights a cigarette, takes his flask of whiskey from the
desk drawer, pours a splash into his coffee, and then into the coffee
cup on Cameron’s desk, and says: “This whole deregulation thing will be
anything but boring. Let me tell you about what’s really happening with
the stock market.”
