Cameron
uses his Jakarta Post credentials to gain access to the reference section. Julia
Suryakusuma, an attractive, bookish woman in her early 20s, is the only staffer speaking fluent English, and so is assigned to fetch the material he needs from the restricted stacks. Cameron explains his mission, and Julia disappears into the stacks, returning shortly with a few books written by foreigners about the period. Skimming through the
material, Cameron's attention is
drawn to a passage in a book by British diplomat John Coast relating events at a gathering of foreign aviators in the mountain town of Bukittinggi, a Republican base of operations.
