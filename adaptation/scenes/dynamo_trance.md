Muharto seeks out the curator, who invites them into his office. Muharto asks the curator to retrieve scraps from the RI-002 wreckage stored at the museum. One of the items is the dynamo with the bullet inexplicably lodged in the windings. Muharto picks it up, and from his point of view, the room around him fades into mist.
