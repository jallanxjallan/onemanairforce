title: Muharto Investigates

Muharto writes to his contacts in the Air Force and to the
officers who participated in the crash-site investigation, but receives
vague, non-committal replies --- or only silence. He then tries his luck
in Air Force archives and government libraries, but finds only disorder
or even active obstruction as civil-service librarians question his
qualifications and motives.
