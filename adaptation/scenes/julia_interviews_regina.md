Regina tells Julia that she was from a village in the ancestral region of Emeria's family. When she turned 16 she was sent to Batavia to work in Emeria's household in exchange for school. She remembers her mistress as highly intelligent with a forceful personality, such as one evening when she deftly defended Hendra to salon guests, who included Dutch colonials.
