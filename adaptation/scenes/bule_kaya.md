Cameron and Julia walk into the lobby of the Hotel Borobudur together,
where her friends are waiting. Julia introduces Cameron to them, then he walks toward
the bar. Julia's friends grill her about the bule, with Julia insisting
that they are not even friends, just new acquaintances. The friends, who
are all *anak jendral*, insist that Julia should go out with him. All bule
are rich, they say, and maybe with his money Julia can finally come with
them on shopping trips to Singapore.
