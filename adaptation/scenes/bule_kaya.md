Cameron and Julia walk into the lobby of the Hotel Borobudur together, where her friends are waiting. Julia introduces Cameron to them, then he walks toward the bar. Julia's friends grill her about the bule, with Julia insisting that they are not even friends, just new acquaintances. 

Afterward, Julia tries to contribute to the bill, but her friends laugh, saying "Honest Eddy's daughter can't afford to pay for her own drinks!" If she wants to pay her own way, they say, she had better get her claws into "Harley Boy".
