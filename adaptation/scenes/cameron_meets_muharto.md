Cameron Bishop, an American journalism student interning at the Jakarta Post, calls on retired Air Force Major Petit Muharto to interview him about his experiences flying blockade runs with Bob Freeberg in his war-surplus Dakota registered to the new Republic of Indonesia as RI-002.  Muharto begins with the surprising message he received at his desk at Maguwo air base in Jogjakarta.
