Bob returns to RI-002 the following morning and is instantly aware that someone had rummaged around his beloved Dakota the previous night. He angrily confronts Muharto, who tells him about the deal with the jewels to buy guns, and adds: “The jewels were entrusted to me by my government,”  “They are my sole responsibility. This has nothing to do with you.”
Bob replies: “Damn you, Muharto! It has everything to do with me! I'm the captain—responsible for whatever happens on my ship, whatever she carries. If you get caught, I also go to jail!”
