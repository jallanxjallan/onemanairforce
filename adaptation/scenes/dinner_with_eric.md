Julia is sitting in a restaurant with Eric, a well-groomed, obviously affluent young man. Eric mentions his surprise Julia's mother phoned his mother to suggest he take her to dinner. Eric dominates the conversation, relating, in grandiose style, how he is an essential component in the business deal that their respective father's are cooking up. Julia wants more details about this "business deal", but decides it would be better to remain silent. Julia picks at her dinner and nods politely.
