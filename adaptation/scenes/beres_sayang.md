Colonel Eddy tells Julia of his guilt in not being able to fulfill the
dreams of his only child. He tells Julia to start applying to
universities in Europe and America. When Julia asks where the tuition
money is coming from, Eddy holds up his hand and says: \" Beres Sayang
\", meaning she should not worry. Ok, says Julia, as long as you are not
planning to marry me off into rich family.
