Five coffins draped in Indonesian flags
lay on a platform in an otherwise empty hanger. A sixth coffin, larger than the rest and without a
flag, rests on a separate platform. A flatbed truck pulls into the
hanger and a squad of airmen, in silence, pick up each
of the flag-draped coffins and place them on the truck. But they leave the sixth
coffin where it lies as the truck pulls away.
