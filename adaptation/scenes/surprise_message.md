Muharto receives a message flown by airborne military courier from Pang Soeparto, an army lieutenant stationed in Tasikmalaya. The message contains the news that a foreign pilot had landed an unmarked cargo aircraft on a nearby beach and, astoundingly, had asked for Muharto by name. Muharto takes this information to his commander, Suryadarma, who agrees that the matter is worth investigation.
