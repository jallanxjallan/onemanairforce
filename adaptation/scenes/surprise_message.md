Muharto is surprised to be given a
message from Army Lieutenant Pang Soeparto, stationed in Tasikmalaya,
informing him that a foreign pilot had landed an unmarked cargo aircraft
on a nearby beach and, astoundingly, had asked for Muharto by name.
Muharto takes this information to his commander, Suryadarma, who tells
him to fly to Tasikmalaya and find out which of Muharto's "foreign
flyboy friends" it might be.
