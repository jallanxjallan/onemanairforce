The gregarious and charismatic Boedi had been wholly accepted by the
Aviation Brotherhood, the freelance, and freewheeling, pilots who
congregated in cheap bars throughout SE Asia. The pilots are reluctant
to accept the stiff and reserved Muharto, but the the charismatic Boedi
is welcomed into the fold. Over drinks in the pilot's favorite pub,
Boedi learns more about Bob, particularly the recognition by his peers
that he is the most skillful and courageous aviator in SouthEast Asia.
Boedi also learns that Freeberg is in considerable financial difficulty,
and was in legal battle with another aviator, Bob Walters, his partner
in purchasing the aircraft now known as RI-002. Walters himself is
scathing in his condemnation, calling Bob a thief and a con man.
