The Dakota lands in Jogjakarta, where Suryadarma commissions Bob to fly
a cargo of high-value quinine to Manila and return with essential
medicines and spare parts. The war-surplus Dakota is still unregistered,
so to forestall potential problems with Philippine authorities, Muharto
suggests that the designation RI-002 be painted on the tail. Bob
protests that since his is the first aircraft registered by Indonesia,
it should be RI-001. Suryadarma explains the RI-001 is being held in
reserve for a future presidential aircraft, which cannot be owned by a
foreigner.
