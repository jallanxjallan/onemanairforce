Pang has fond memories of partying with Freeberg, Muharto, and Boediarjo when they sold the quinine in September 1947, and how Captain Ignatio Espina, the Filipino army commando who they would be taking back to Jogja to train youth militias, become so boisterously drunk that Freeberg and the other pilots had to restrain him.
