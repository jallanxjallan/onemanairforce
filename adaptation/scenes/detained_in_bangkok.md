Bob flies two Indonesian aviators, Halim and Iswandi, to Bangkok. There, they will purchase an Avro-Anson and fly it back to Jogja as RI-003. Bob is detained by Thai authorities at the insistence of Dutch diplomats, Bob is accomodated in a comfortable hotel room, but the others, who are not detained, must find cheap beds among the hookers and petty criminals of a Bangkok red-light district. Boedi is delighted, but Halim and Iswandi worry about appearances, as both will marry immediately after  completing their mission. A few days later, Bob is released in a tacit recognition by Thai authorities of the legitimacy of the new Republic of Indonesia.
