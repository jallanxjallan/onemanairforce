Muharto stays with Bob's friend Tom Lee, a government lawyer. Over breakfast, Tom reads the newspaper headlines
about "Fearless Bob Freeberg" and his "Javanese Crew". One article
reports that the Dutch are laying claim to the valuable quinine cargo as
the "Javanese Crew" are "subjects of the Dutch Queen".
