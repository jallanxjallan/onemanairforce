Bob invites Muharto, Pang, and Boedi to his apartment to celebrate that morning's verdict awarding the quinine to them. Bob's housemate has a military-grade short-wave radio, currently not working. Boedi opens the unit, pokes around, and it soon bursts into life. Boedi scans the military and civilian frequencies. The party mood vanishes when a news broadcast announces that an Indian blockade runner had been shot down on approach to Maguwo. All look toward Bob, and he nods in acknowledgement that RI-002 might be the last remaining hope to connect the Republic with the rest of the world.
