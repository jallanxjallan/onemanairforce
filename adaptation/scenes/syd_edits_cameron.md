Cameron writes up the interview, and gives it to managing editor Sabam Siagian, who had given him the assignment. Sabam glances at the copy, grunts, then passes the pages to Syd Jardine, the senior copy editor. Syd reads it carefully, then remarks that Freeberg comes off as a "super-pilot" and not believable. He  suggests Cameron find other accounts of Bob by researching in the reference section of the newly opened National Library.
