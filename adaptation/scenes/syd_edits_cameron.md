Cameron writes up the interview, and gives it to Sabam Siagian, who grudgingly approves. He passes it to Syd Jardine, who remarks that Freeberg comes off as a "super-pilot" and not believable. He  suggests Cameron find other accounts of Bob by researching in the reference section of the newly opened National Library.
