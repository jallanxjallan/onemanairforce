Cameron submits his article to Syd Jardine, a retired foreign correpondent assisting the Jakarta Times, an English-language newspaper set up by a business mogul to promote foreign investment in Indonesia. Syd remarks that Freeberg comes across as a "white savior" singlehandedly responsible for Indonesia gaining freedom from the Dutch. He notes that there were many foreign pilots helping the Indonesians. He suggests Cameron flesh out the story by reading accounts of Freeberg written by foreigners in the region. The newly opened National Library has these books in the reference section. Syd writes an introductory letter on Jakarta Times letterhead to give Cameron access to the restricted stacks.
