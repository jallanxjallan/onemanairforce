```synopsis
Bob takes June to a party thrown by Salipada Penatun to celebrate the
sale of the quinine. Salipada Penatun offers to have Walters
deported. Tom Lee suggests that such a move would have unintended
consequences. Bob thanks Penatun for his offer, but says they should
just put everything behind them.
