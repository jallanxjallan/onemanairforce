Muharto takes Bob for an afternoon walk to introduce him to Jogja, and they visit the palace of the former Dutch governor, now repurposed as the seat of the Indonesian Republic. As Bob admires the architecture, he is astounded to suddenly be ushered into the
office of President Soekarno. As is his custom in private conversation,
Soekarno treats Bob as an equal and puts him at ease, imploring the
American to help his people in their struggle for freedom.
