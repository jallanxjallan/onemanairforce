<p><strong>26 September 1988 - Jakarta Post Newsroom</strong> Sabam Siagian, managing editor of the Jakarta Post, assigns Cameron, an American copy editor, to interview his friend Petit Muharto about his experiences running the Dutch blockade with Bob Freeberg.</p>
<p><strong>28 September 1988 - Muharto living room</strong> Cameron meets Muharto, a dapper, energetic Indonesian man in his late sixties, at his tidy residence in a Jakarta suburb. Muharto recounts his exploits in RI-002 in such vivid detail that Cameron can clearly visualize the events Muharto is describing starting with a surprise telephone call he received at Maguwo Airbase in Jogjakarta on June 1947.</p>
<p><strong>1 June 1947 - Muhartos office Maguwo</strong> Muharto receives a telephone call in Air Force headquarters in Jogja from an army base in Tasikmalaya to report that a foreign pilot has landed on a remote beach nearby and asked for Muharto by name. Suryadarma, the Air Force commander, sends Muharto there to investigate.</p>
<p><strong>7 June 1947 - In the air</strong> Flying to Tasik in a refurbished Japanese aircraft, whose pilot had only first seen an airplane a few months previously, Muharto takes his mind from possible catastrophe by recollecting his experiences during his blockade runs three months previously, wondering which pilot it might be.</p>
<p><strong>31 March 1947 - CALI aircraft cockpit</strong> On the third blockade run, with Bob Freeberg as captain, the overcast sky forces Muharto to navigate by asking Bob to fly low enough to follow the railway line to Jogja.</p>
<p><strong>31 March 1947 - Maguwo airfield</strong> In Jogja, Muharto introduces Bob to Suryadarma, who thanks the American for his assistance, and asks him to perform some risky tasks on the return leg. Bob grins and readily agrees.</p>
<p><strong>31 March 1947 - Karangendah Airfield</strong> Muharto asks Bob to make a test landing on a refurbished wartime airstrip designed for smaller aircraft such as fighters. Bob happily complies, and sets the Dakota down with only a few meters to spare on the runway. Muharto introduces Bob to Santoso, the base commander.</p>
<p><strong>31 March 1947 - CALI Dakota cockpit</strong> Bob uses his wartime aviation skills to parachute Air Force engineers and their gear to a bull's eye landing on a pot-holed highland airstrip they are tasked to refurbish.</p>
<p><strong>8 June 1947 - Tasik Army Base</strong> In Tasik Muharto meets Pang Soeparto, the junior army officer who telephoned him, who takes him (and two barrels of aviation fuel) to the beach at Cikolong. As soon as Muharto sees the beach, bookended by two rivers and the gap between the water and palm trees scarcely more than the Dakota's wing span, he knew that, of all the pilots he had met, only Bob Freeberg had the skill to make that landing.</p>
<p><strong>9 June 1947 - Cikolong Beach</strong> Bob tells Muharto that his Dakota is stuck in the soft sand. Muharto rallies the hundreds of villagers who have gathered for the spectacle of the foreigner and his giant aircraft to tear apart their houses and use the woven bamboo walls as a makeship runway. The Dakata takes off with Muharto on board and heads to Jogja.</p>
<p><strong>9 June 1947 - Maguwo Airfield Jogja</strong> In Jogja, Suradarma commissions Bob to fly a cargo valuable quinine to Manila and return with medicine and other goods.

<p><strong>10 July 1947 - RI-002 cockpit in flight</strong> Bob invites Muharto to sit in co-pilot seat and assist him with the flap controls during the final approach to Manila. But when Bob gives the command, the nervous Muharto pushed the levers to the full causing the Dakota to make a dramatic drop. Bob instantly repositions the levers, and gently reminds Muharto to not pass the half-flaps setting until they see the runway.</p>
<p><strong>12 June 1947 - Tom Lee Kitchen</strong> Over breakfast at Tom Lee's house, Tom reads the newspaper headlines about "Fearless Bob Freeberg" and his "Javanese Crew". One article reports that the Dutch are laying claim to the valuable quinine cargo as the "Javanese Crew" are "subjects of the Dutch Queen". Boedi laughs, but Muharto is outraged.</p>
<p><strong>20 June 1947 - courtroom Manila</strong> Bob and Muharto attend their first court session to decide who owns Dutch representatives take them to court over possession of the quinine cargo.</p>
<p><strong>29 July 1947 - Freeberg apartment</strong> Muharto and Boedi listen in horror to shortwave radio reports that a blockade runner has been shot down on approach to Maguwo.</p>
<p><strong>August 1947 - Intel HQ Manila</strong> During the long wait to sell the quinine, Muharto acts as de facto military representative of the Republic. He meets Major Primitivo of the intelligence service, who introduces Muharto to Captain Ignacio Espina, a guerrilla who fought the Japanese occupation of the Philippines. Espina, nicknamed Ining, will accompany RI-002 back to Jogja, where he will transfer his guerrilla warfare skills to the young militia members of the Tentara Pelajar.</p>
<p><strong>September 1947 - Madras Curry Manila</strong> Muharto attempts to pay for their meals at Madras Curry, explaining that it is an honorarium for the talk to the lady lawyers. To his surprise, Bob chastises him for "taking money for nothing".</p>
<p><strong>21 September 1947 - RI-002 cockpit in flight</strong> RI-002 returns to Jogja, flying non-stop to conceal the presence of Captain Espina. They reach Java after dusk, with landmarks difficult to discern in the gloom.

<p><strong>October 1947 - Presidential Palace Jogja</strong> Muharto takes Bob to meet Soekarno . At the presidential palace. As was his custom in private conversation, Soekarno treats Bob as an equal and urges him to stay and help the struggle.</p>

<p><strong>30 November 1947 - RI-002 at Maguwo</strong> Freeberg, Muharto and Boedi fly Republican economists and other experts to Manila to meet with United Nations representatives in the hill town of Baguio. The delegates, who are all prominent figures in the Republic and have cosmopolitan backgrounds, treat Bob with as much respect as do the hero-worshipping common people of Jogja.</p>
<p><strong>28 September 1988 - Muhartos Living Room</strong> Muharto tells Cameron that he flew with RI-002 until May 1948, when he was promoted to Major and assigned to a desk at headquarters. He saw little of Bob after that, but was looking forward to having Bob as guest of honor at his wedding in October. But three weeks before the wedding he was devasted to learn that RI-002 had vanished on a mission.</p>
<p><strong>28 September 1988 - Muhartos living room</strong> Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash site, wholly by accident, some five years previously. He wrote to his contacts in the Air Force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site investigation, but received vague, non-committal replies --- or only silence.</p>
<p><strong>19 April 1977 - Mount Punggur</strong> An Air Force team investigating the crash site find a few human remains, confirmation that it was RI-002, but no sign of the gold cargo.</p>
<p><strong>29 July 1977 - Teluk Betulu Air Force base</strong> In an otherwise empty hanger, five coffins draped in Indonesian flags lay on a platform. A sixth coffin, larger than the rest and without a flag, rests on a separate platform. A flatbed truck pulls in to the hanger and a a squad of airmen, all silent and respectful pick up each of the coffins and place them on the truck. But they leave the sixth coffin where it lies as the truck pulls away.</p>
<p><strong>28 September 1988 - Muhartos Living Room</strong> Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob’s remains, could not be buried with the others as a foreigner cannot be interred in a cemetery for national heroes, however much he may deserve the honor himself through his services to the nation.</p>
<p>Muharto’s expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying, wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of RI-002 than they are telling.</p>
<p><strong>29 September 1988 - Jakarta Post Newsroom</strong> Syd Jardine, a burnt-out Old Asia Hand who is senior copy editor for the Jakarta Post, tells Cameron that his story on Bob Freeberg needs more historical context, and suggests he do additional research at the new National Library, a modern, well-run institution that he visits regularly.</p>
<p><strong>5 October 1988 - Library Reference Section</strong> At the National Libary, Cameron is assisted by Julia, a bookish, attractive final-year student assigned to deal with foreign researchers because of her fluent English.</p>
<p><strong>February 1948 - Bukittinggi</strong> In *Recruit to Revolution*, John Coast describes Freeberg as “America’s Best Ambassador” after their first meeting. Nevertheless, he notes that American officials in Batavia, who wanted Indonesia to remain in Dutch hands, disapproved of his activities.</p>
<p><strong>5 October 1988 - library canteen</strong> Julia and Cameron have coffee in the library canteen. She says that she is in her final year of university, and hopes to get a scholarship to do her post-grad overseas. In the meantime, she was hired by the library because of her fluency in written English and Dutch. Julia also casually mentions that her father is a general.</p>
<p><strong>3 October 1988 - JP newsroom</strong> The day the story about Bob Freeberg appears, Sabam berates Syd for sneaking an amusing tone-perfect translation of a lurid sex-crime story from a local paper into the Post. He then praises Cameron for the Muharto story, saying that his old friend was delighted. When Sabam leaves, Cameron turns to Syd and says he is intrigued by the story, and wants to return to the Library for further research. With a smile and a wink, Syd tells Cameron to give his regards to Julia.</p>
<p><strong>October 1988 - National Library</strong> At the library, Julia introduces Cameron to Victor, a retired journalist for the colonial-era *Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad*.

<p><strong>October 1988 - Jakarta Post</strong> The stories from the Dutch side of RI-002 story fires Camerons's curiosity. Cameron tells Sabam that he would like to do more research into the story as a basis for a grad-school paper when he returns home. Sabam wishes him luck, but tells Cameron to do it on his own time and do not involve the Jakarta Post. Syd tells Cameron that Sabam is right. The government does not like journalists or academics reexamining the past. If the fate of Bob Freeberg remains a mystery, they must think it is for good reason, perhaps to avoid questions about what might have happened to the gold.</p>
<p><strong>3 October 1988 - Muharto living room</strong> Cameron visits Muharto to help solve the mystery of RI-002. Muharto is delighted, and suggest they begin with a visit to Jogjakarta, where pieces of the RI-002 wreckage is kept.</p>
