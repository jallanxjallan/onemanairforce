During the Soekarno Tour, Bob flies low over a town where an important regional leader lives to determine whether he can land RI-002 safely on an overgrown grass airstrip. Bob decides not to risk the safety of his passengers, which infuriates Soekarno. He demands that Bob land on the strip, declaring: "Im the president!" Bob replies, in a measured tone and pointing downward: "Down there, sir, indeed you are the president. But up here, I'm the captain."
