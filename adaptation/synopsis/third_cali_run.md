synopsis: Muharto guides Bob Freeberg to Jogja during a blockade run from Singapore. 
---
Bob Freeberg is at the controls of the Dakota CALI blockade run from Singapore to Jogja. Petit Muharto stands in the cockpit behind Freeberg, staring out the window at the cloud cover below them, broken by the tips of volcanic cones. In the featureless cloudscape, Muharto cannot identify the mountains with any certainty. Freeberg spots a break in the cloud cover and dives through it. The co-pilot looks at Freeberg in alarm, and Miss Brown clutches the cockpit doorframe and gasps. The Dakota reaches the bottom of the cloud layer, and Muharto can see they are in a wide valley with a clear view south to the sea. Muharto spots a railway line, and tells Freeberg that it snakes through the lowland valleys between here and their destination. Freeberg smiles and banks the Dakota to follow the line.  

In Jogjakarta, Suryadarma tells Muharto that this will be his last blockade run. An Indian businessman has offered to link India with the Republic with his own Dakota, registered as VT-CLA. He has the full support of the Indian government, so further chartered runs will not be necessary. Muharto is disappointed, but this will be memorable, as Suryadarma asks Bob to make a couple of detours on the way back to Singapore. Bob cheerfully agrees.  

Two hours later, the CALI Dakota circles a refurbished Japanese airstrip at Karangendah on the grasslands of south Sumatra. Muharto doubts that the strip can accommodate an aircraft of this size, but Bob replies that he did
this all the time in the war: "I can land on a dime and give you a
nickel change." 

Bob makes a spectacular landing, engines roaring with reverse thrust. Muharto asks if he can take off again. Bob replies:
"I hope so. We seem to be smack dab in the middle of nowhere." 

Santoso, the base commander climbs aboard to meet them.
After a short conversation, Santoso exits, and Bob takes off, the wheels
finally lifting off the runway a few meters before the end. 

Shortly thereafter, the CALI Dakota flies over the Bukit Barisan mountaintops, and drops
into a valley toward the town of Bukittinggi. Bob passes low over an airstrip, which is  full of potholes and
so unusable. The two other passengers, both uniformed soliders, don parachutes and prepare to jump. Bob ask Muharto to tell the soldiers that he must drop them at minimum height, else the high wind will carry them in the surrounding mountains. The co-pilot leaves his seat and goes to the cargo
compartment, motioning to Miss Brown and Muharto to sit down far from
the door. The co-pilot wrenches open the door, and scraps of paper and
cardboard swirl as the air stream enters the cabin. Bob flies low and slow over the airstrip, the aircraft shuddering on the verge of stalling, The soldiers jump, and Muharto sees their chutes open barely in time for a safe landing.
