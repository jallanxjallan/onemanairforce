Bob Freeberg is at the controls of the Dakota CALI blockade run from Singapore to Jogja. Petit Muharto stands in the cockpit behind Freeberg, staring out the window at the cloud cover below them, broken by the tips of volcanic cones. In the featureless cloudscape, Muharto cannot identify the mountains with any certainty. Freeberg spots a break in the cloud cover and dives through it. The co-pilot looks at Freeberg in alarm, and Miss Brown clutches the cockpit doorframe and gasps. The Dakota reaches the bottom of the cloud layer, and Muharto can see they are in a wide valley with a clear view south to the sea. Muharto spots a railway line, and tells Freeberg to follow it to Jogja. Freeberg smiles and banks the Dakota, while Muharto desperately tries to remember if the tracks tunnel through any mountains before it reaches Jogja.
