Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bobs
remains, could not be buried with the others because he was a foreigner.
Muhartos expression as he finishes his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. As Cameron rises to leave, Muharto wonders that if he had turned down promotion and had been with Bob on the final flight, maybe it would not have ended in tragedy.
