RI-002 returns to Jogja, flying non-stop to conceal the presence of Captain Espina. They reach Java after dusk, with landmarks difficult to discern in the gloom. After some hesitation, during which tension rises in the cockpit, Muharto draws upon a vivid schoolboy memory to identify a range of hills and guides the aircraft to Jogja.
