On the evening of 10 October 1988, Cameron is having a drink at the
Earthquake Bar, chatting with Sanyoto, when Colonel Eddy, out of
uniform, takes the empty seat beside him. Sanyoto introduces "Pak Eddy"
to Cameron and leaves them to chat. Eddy is affable, and asks Cameron
general questions about how he likes Indonesia and other pleasantries.
Then the conversation shifts to pointed inquiries about Cameron's
education and life goals. After Eddy leaves, Cameron remarks to Sanyoto
that he feels like he has just been interrogated.

On the morning of 12 October 1988, Eddy has a heart-to-heart talk with
Julia, letting her know that he opposes Julia marrying a foreigner. Eddy
has checked into Cameron's background, and found he is penniless and
with a spotty academic record, though he excelled in journalism and
seems to be a good writer. Julia retorts that her relationship with
Cameron is purely professional. If the story they are researching
results in a book, her expert facilitation will look good on a future
application for graduate school.
