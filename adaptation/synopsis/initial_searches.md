Muharto tells Cameron that the situation was so chaotic, with the Dutch threatening to invade the Republic, that a proper search of the rugged terrain on the flight path was not possible. The wreckage was only discovered three decades later by two local farmers searching for land to till. They immediately reported their find to local authorities, and a few days later led an Air Force investigation team to the site.
