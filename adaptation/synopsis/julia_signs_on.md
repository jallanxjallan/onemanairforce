Cameron returns to the library for more research. He tells Julia about partnering with Muharto to investigate the mystery and the visit with Boediarjdo and his offer of assistance. Julia, with some enthusiasm, also offers to help, as she can easily read Dutch-language reports and records from the period. She also offers to introduce Cameron to Victor de Jong, a Dutch-born, naturalized Indonesian photographer who had worked directly under General Simon Spoor, the commander of the colonial military.
