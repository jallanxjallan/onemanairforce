Julia offers to help with research and to contact interviewees. Notes that she went to school and attended weddings with the children of most of the retired officials Cameron might want to meet.  Julia suggests they start by visiting Victor de Jong, a Dutch conscript who had taken the opportunity to resign from the colonial military and taken on Indonesian citizenship in the months after independence. During the struggle, Victor had been a photo analyst in Spoor's office, and might be able to provide some insight into the Dutch side of the Freeberg mystery.
