Muharto receives a telephone call at his desk in Maguwo Air Base near Jogjakarta. On the line is Pang Soeparto, an army lieutenant stationed in Tasikmalaya, forming him that an American landed an unmarked cargo aircraft on a nearby beach and is asking for him by name. The connection is poor, and Muharto can not make out the pilot's name or any other information. Muharto takes this information to his commander, Suryadarma, who agrees that the matter is worth investigation. Muharto flies to Tasikmalaya in an open-cockpit Japanese monoplane.
