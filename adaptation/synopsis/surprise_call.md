Muharto receives a telephone call at his desk in Maguwo Air Base near Jogjakarta. On the line is Pang Soeparto, an army lieutenant stationed in Tasikmalaya, forming him that an American landed an unmarked cargo aircraft on a nearby beach and is asking for him by name. The connection is poor, and Muharto can not make out the pilot's name or any other information. Muharto takes this information to his commander, Suryadarma, who agrees that the matter is worth investigation. Muharto flies to Tasikmalaya in an open-cockpit Japanese monoplane.    

This aircraft, a Nikosoren, was one of a score barely servicable planes the Japanese had left behind. The air force mechanics kept these aircraft flying through skill and guesswork, but Muharto was aware that any flight could end in disaster. To keep his mind from this eventuality, Muharto  thought about the American pilots he had met during the blockade runs he had organized from Singapore to Jogjakarta. He  decided that only Bob Freeberg possessed the skill and nerve to land at night on a remote beach. Bob had been the pilot of the third blockade run. Though these had been standard charter flights -- they even had a flight attendant, a lovely Filipina named Miss Brown -- the third flight would test the skills of any aviator.
