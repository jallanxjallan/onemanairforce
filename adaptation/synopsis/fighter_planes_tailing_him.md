While flying a group of international journalists to Jogja under cover of darkness, Fowler believes he spots Dutch fighters flanking him. His radio operator, a Dutch-speaking Indonesian monitoring military frequencies, hears fighter pilots asking permission to engage an intercepted aircraft. The request is denied as "there are civilians on board". Looking out his left-hand window, Fowler clearly sees the silhouette of a fighter, wings almost vertical as it banks away.
