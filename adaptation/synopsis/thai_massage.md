Bob flies two Indonesian aviators, Halim and Iswandi, to Bangkok. to purchase a twin-prop airplane that will become RI-003. Dutch authorities pressure the Thai government to detain Freeberg as a blockade runner. The Thais briefly detain Freeberg in a comfortable hotel room, but the Indonesian crew must find their own accommodation. They can only afford rooms in a bar district. Boedi is delighted, but Halim and Iswandi are appalled. Both are engaged to be married, and worry that the families of their respective fianc√©es will learn that they have stayed in such a disreputable environment.
