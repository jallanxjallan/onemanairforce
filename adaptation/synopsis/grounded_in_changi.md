RI-002 departs for Pekanbaru carrying 14 Republican officials and a coffin containing Inings remains. The plan was to drop the officials in Pekanbaru and then fly to Manila. However, cloud cover make a landing there impossible, so RI-002 was rerouted to Singapore. At the request of Dutch diplomats, the British declared RI-002 be unairworthy, and grounded the aircraft until repairs could be made.
