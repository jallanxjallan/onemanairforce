Julia finds a photo of RI-002 seemingly guarded by Dutch soldier. She shows it to Cameron and Victor, who recognizes the airfield from the survey processed 40 years before. Victor suspects it might be Karangendah, though he is certain the runway, meant for fighters, is too short for a Dakota. But Cameron remembers from the first Muharto interview that Bob had landed successfully on the CALI blockade run. 

Julia checks a list of military installations and discovers that Karangendah is now a tank-training ground, and as such a high-security base. Cameron could never be granted permission to enter. But Cameron says he must try, and leaves to book his flight to Palembang.
