Cameron and Julia are hunched over a reading table, Julia translating
Dutch-language headlines. Julia tells Cameron they she must leave, as
she is meeting friends at the Hotel Borobudur. Cameron says that he also
has a date for drinks with a buddy at that hotel, and offers her a ride.
She accepts, and is nonplussed when he takes her to an army surplus
Harley Davidson motorcycle in the parking lot. During the thrilling
ride, she briefly grabs Camerons waist, to her embarrassment. 

Cameron and Julia walk into the lobby of the Hotel Borobudur together,
where her friends are waiting. Julia introduces Cameron to them, then he
walks toward the bar, while Julia and her friends proceed to the coffee shop. 

Julia friends grill her about the bule. Julia insists that they have only a professional relationship, research assistant to a journalist. When they are about to leave, Julia tries to contribute to the bill, but her friends laugh, saying "Honest Eddy's daughter can't afford to pay for her own drinks!" If she
wants to do that, they say, she had better get her claws into Harley
boy.
