Cameron follows Anwar through a hole in the perimeter fence and onto the base. He takes Cameron to the end of the runway, where he crouches in the brush and takes photographs. Anwar disappears, returning several minutes later carrying a few small boxes. These, he explains, are military-quality diesel injectors which he installs on smuggling craft who cannot afford an engine breakdown in the middle of the Malacca Strait.
