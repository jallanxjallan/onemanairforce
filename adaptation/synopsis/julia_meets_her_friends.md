title: Julia Meets Her Friends
---
Cameron and Julia walk into the lobby of the Hotel Borobudur together,
where her friends are waiting. Julia introduces Cameron to them, then he
walks toward the bar, while Julia and her friends proceed to the coffee shop. 

Julia friends grill her about the bule. Julia insists that they have only a professional relationship, research assistant to a journalist. When they are about to leave, Julia tries to contribute to the bill, but her friends laugh, saying "Honest Eddys daughter cant afford to pay for her own drinks!" If she
wants to do that, they say, she had better get her claws into Harley
boy.
