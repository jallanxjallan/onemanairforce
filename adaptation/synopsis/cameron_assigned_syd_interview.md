Cameron grows frustrated that his interview subjects keep him waiting for hours, or cancel altogether. Richard loses patience at the lack of stories. He offers Cameron a final chance. Richard assigns an interview with retired journalist, Syd Jardine, who lives in Indonesia and has attained notoriety for the hilarious, tone-perfect translations of salacious reports in local tabloids he slips past the editors of the Jakarta Times, where he works as check editor. Richard knows Syd from his glory days, and tells Cameron to buy him dinner and a few beers, for which he will be reimbursed.
