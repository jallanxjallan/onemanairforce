In early May 1948 With the reassignment of Muharto to headquarters,
Bambang gets his coveted permanent spot in the right-hand seat of
RI-002.

One morning in May 1948, the landing gear collapses just as RI-002 is
preparing to take off from the strip at Bukittinggi. Bob checks the wing
for damage, and decides that the new crack in not serious. Later that
morning he takes off. Dave Fowler looks on, shaking his head.

On the Soekarno Tour in mid June 1948 Bambang ingratiates himself with
Soekarno in the hope of being selected to fly RI-001. Boedi finds his
efforts, and Soekarno's condescending replies, amusing.

During the Soekarno tour In mid June 1948, Bob refuses Soekarno's order
to land on unsafe airfield. Soekarno is annoyed, but then commends Bob
for standing up to him.

In late June 1948 during a speech on an airstrip, Soekarno points to Bob
in the cockpit, proclaiming: "This is Bob Freeberg, a brave, good man
and a friend of all Indonesians"

On 1 July 1948 Suryadarma orders Bob to Sumatra on another mission. Bob
refuses, and infuriates Suryadarma by returning to Manila that day.
