Muharto tells Cameron he bid Freeberg farewell in Singapore and returned
to Jogja some days later on VT-CLA. Two months later, Muharto flew into
Tasik, meeting Pang Suparto, who confirmed that the pilot was indeed Bob
Freeberg. They loaded two barrels of aviation fuel into a jeep and drove
to the beach.
