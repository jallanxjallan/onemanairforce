Syd takes Cameron to the Earthquake Bar for a drink He introduces
Cameron to the owner, Sanyoto, an Air Force drill sergeant during the
revolution and fixer for a large foreign company. Sanyoto maintains wide
contacts in the highest levels of government and the military, so the
Earthquake is popular with generals and cabinet ministers. Sanyoto tells
Cameron he is always welcome here, as long as he minds his manners and
doesn't "needle" any of his regular guests.
