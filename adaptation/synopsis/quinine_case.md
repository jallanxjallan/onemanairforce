At the court session, the Dutch call to the stand an agriculture expert to testify that the Republic does not have
the capability to process quinine, so the drug must have been produced
in a Dutch-owed factory before the war. Muharto is ready to jump to his to protest this insult to his people's technological skill, but Penatun
motions for him to sit down, then calmly tells the judge: "A foreigner
is not qualified to discuss the internal matters of the sovereign
Republic of Indonesia." The judge considers this, obviously with some
sympathy, and adjourns the session, promising to render a verdict the following month.
