# Cameron Delivers Magazines

Cameron visits Muharto to deliver a few
copies of the story. Muharto is delighted, telling Cameron that friends
and colleagues had contacted him from throughout Southeast Asia in
response to the article. All were eager to know what happened to
Freeberg and the gold. Muharto tells Cameron that he had attemped to
investigate the mystery a few years previously. Muharto describes his
farcical, frustrating attempts to wrest information from the
disorganized Air Force archives and government reference libraries
scattered throughout the city, guarded by officious petty burearcrats.

Cameron notes that with the archives now consoldiated and managed by
competent professionals, perhaps he should resume his research. Muharto
suggests that they collaborate on new investigations with an eye to
writing a book. Cameron agrees, and Muharto suggests they begin with a
long-overdue visit to an old friend.
