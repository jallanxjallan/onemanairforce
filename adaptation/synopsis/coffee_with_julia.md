title: Coffee With Julia
status: new
---

In early October 1988 Cameron invites Julia to join him for coffee
before starting his shift at the Jakarta Post. Over coffee, Julia tells
Cameron of her dream of securing a scholarship to pursue post-graduate
studies in America. Cameron attempts, in turn, to tell of his dreams of
becoming an international investigative journalist. But Julia stops him,
saying, with a mischievous smile, that if she wants to know anything
about him she will simply ask her father, who is a senior officer in
military intelligence. Cameron puts down his coffee, looks around
involuntarily, then tells Julia it is time for him to go.
