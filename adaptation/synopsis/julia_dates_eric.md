Julia goes on a date with Eric, the son of friends of her parents, who arranged the occasion. Eric dominates the conversation with boasting about the deal their respective fathers are making to supply "insider" information to foreign stock market brokers supposedly from Colonel Eddy's intelligence services. Julia knows full when that he father would be shot for leaking any intelligence information, so this must be a scam, and the only victims foreigners, not Indonesians.
