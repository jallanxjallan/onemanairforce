They met when she invited Victor to her studio in response to an article he had written praising an exhibition at the Kuntskring. Through Emeria, Victor meets prominent Republican figures, who  Spoor and the colonial government seek to portray as opportunistic thugs and bandits. Victor is astounded to discover that most are well-educated with sophisticated and pragmatic political beliefs.
