On 27 December 1947, RI-003 crashes on a beach in Malaya.

During a routine radio contact with Jogja on 17 December 1947, Boedi is
told that Ining and Mas Ded were found dead of gunshot wounds at Ining's
house.

On 18 December 1947, Muharto reports Ining's death to Primitivo. Muharto
is astounded when the major accuses Muharto and his brother of being
clandestine communists, and detains Muharto for a day for interrogation.

On 29 December 1947, RI-002 departs for Pekanbaru carrying 14 Republican
officials and a coffin containing Ining's remains. Bad weather over
Pekanbaru forces RI-002 to divert to Singapore. Dutch representatives on
the island pressure the British into grounding the Dakota because of
"airworthiness" issues.

On 15 January 1948, British officials open Ining's coffin, searching for
contraband. Finding none, and with RI-002 brought up to minimal
airworthiness standards, they granted Bob permission to depart, to the
great annoyance of the Dutch.
