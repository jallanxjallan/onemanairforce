As the aircraft is being unloaded and refueled for the return to Singapore, Muharto introduces Bob to Suryadarma, who thanks him for his assistance. Then Suryadarma takes Muharto aside and tells him that this will be his last blockade run. An Indian businessman has offered to link India with the Republic with his own Dakota, VT-CLA, and has the full support of the Indian government, so further chartered runs will not be necessary.
