Before they leave, Muharto goes into another room to chat with Ibu Boedi, who has a gift for Muhartos wife Ani. Cameron admires Boedis extensive art collection and his top-end audio system. Boedi beams, and wishes Cameron success in solving the mystery of RI-002. Boedi stays that Muharto has had a difficult life, and learning the fate of his friend might give him comfort. He invites Cameron to ask for his assistance if required.
