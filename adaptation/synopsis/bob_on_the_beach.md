On an evening in **June 1947**, Bob Freeberg, a young American veteran Navy pilot, lands his unmarked Dakota
cargo plane on a remote beach in southwest Java. The villagers, though astounded, are friendly, and offer Bob and his two Filipino crew food. The next morning, however, Republic of Indonesia soldiers
arrive and threaten to shoot Bob as a Dutch spy. Bob pleads for his life
with the only Indonesian words he knows: "*Kapten Petit Muharto*."
