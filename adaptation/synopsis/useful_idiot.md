Cameron asks some perfunctory questions about foreign investment, then changes the subject to the revolution, and the time Tahija worked for Spoor. Tahija is surprised at the question, but revels in the opportunity to relive those exciting times. Cameron mentions Victor. Tahija grins, and tells Cameron that Victor had been a "Useful Idiot", an intelligence asset Spoor used to keep tabs on the Republican intellectuals in Batavia through the "secret" relationship with Emeria.
