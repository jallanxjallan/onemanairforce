Cameron accompanies Muharto to a village on the upper slopes of the
Merapi volcano to meet Muhartos spiritual advisor, Mbah Maridjan. The
three hike the steep incline to a shrine, effortlessly in the case of
the sexagenarian duo of Muharto and Maridjan, but with some difficulty
by their companion, some four decades their junior. Cameron watches
respectfully as the two intone Islamic prayers, then lay Hindu-style
floral offerings at the shrine to the gods of the mountain.
