On 27 December 1948 Ani gives Westerling a tongue lashing to divert
attention while Muharto swallows his air force identification.

In early December 1988 Julia tracks down Emiria teaching art to children
in a village on the outskirts of Jogja. Emeria reveals that she after
independence she traveled to the Netherlands on a "colonial guilt"
scholarship, married a Dutch academic, and returned to Indonesia after
his death a few years previously. Emeria regrets using Victor, but says
that in war you have to choose sides.

In late December 1988 Julia tells Victor that Emira was using him as an
asset.
