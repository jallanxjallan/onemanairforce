Muharto takes Cameron to the Air Force museum in Jogja, a re-purposed
hanger filled with decommissioned aircraft and other exhibits. Muharto
points to a model of the Zogling training glider, and tells Cameron of
training village boys who had never seen an airplane to become skilled
pilots in mere weeks. 

Muharto seeks out the curator, who invites them
into his office. Muharto asks the curator to retrieve scraps from the
RI-002 wreckage stored at the museum. One of the items is the dynamo
with the bullet inexplicably lodged in the windings. Muharto picks it
up, and from his point of view, the room around him fades into mist. 

Muharto looks around to see he is in the radio nook of RI-002. The airplane shutters as the engines scream in protest. Muharto sees two shadowy figures in the pilot seats, and a forested mountainside fills the window. 

Then the curators office room comes back into focus, and Muharto sees the concerned faces of
Cameron and the curator. Muharto places the dynamo back into the storage
box and say is is time to go back to Jakarta.
