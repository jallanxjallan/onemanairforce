Bob invites Muharto to sit in co-pilot seat and assist him with the flap controls during the final approach to Manila. In his anxiety at his first time in the pilot seat of an airplane in flight, Muharto sets the flaps to full. In a flash, Bob sets the flaps correctly, and winks at Muharto, saying "No harm done, just be more careful next time."
