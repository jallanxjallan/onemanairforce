Julia is sitting in a restaurant with Eric, a well-groomed, obviously
affluent young man. Eric mentions his surprise Julia's mother phoned his
mother to suggest he take her to dinner. Eric dominates the
conversation, relating, in grandiose style, his ambition to become a
major player in the stock market, which is being deregulated to allow
direct investment by foreigners in Indonesian companies. Julia picks at
her dinner and nods politely.
