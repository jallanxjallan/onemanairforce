In a telephone call, Richard Beth, Cameron's editor in Hong Kong, tells him to confirm Muharto's account with newspaper archive research. He cannot run a story based on one old man's memories. He tells Cameron to go to the new national library in Jakarta and find some mention of Freeberg in contemporaneous accounts.  Richard also reminds Cameron that his report on the upcoming finanacial-market deregulation is due, eliciting a barely audible sigh from Cameron.
