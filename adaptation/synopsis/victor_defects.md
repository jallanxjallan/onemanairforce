Spoor assigns Victor to follow Westerling, who is to be Spoors eyes on the ground during the invasion of Jogja. Victor witnesses the encounter between Westerling and the Muhartos. He decides that if the "Butcher of Makassar" can be tongue-lashed by a slip of a native girl, then the time of the Dutch has truly ended. Late that evening, he is contacted by a friend of Emiria. She is waiting for him in the hills. He asks Victor to come with him, and to bring as many guns and as much ammunition as he can.
