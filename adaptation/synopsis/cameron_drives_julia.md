title: Cameron Drops Off Julia
---

Cameron and Julia realize that they are both headed to the Hotel Hilton
-- he to the bar, her to the coffee shop -- to meet friends. Cameron
offers her a lift. Julia's friends see Cameron drop her off. Her
friends, like Julia the daughters of high military officers, discuss
their plans to attend presigious universities in major world capitals,
paid for by their fathers' corrupt earnings from side businesses. They
joke that since Julia's father, Colonel Eddy, works in the intelligence
service, a "dry" posting, hooking up with Cameron is her best chance to
study abroad.
