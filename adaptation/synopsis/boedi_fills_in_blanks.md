In December 1946 Bob partners with Singapore-based businessman Hugh
Savage to start Southeastern Airlines.

In March 1947, Bob Freeberg joins with Bob Walters to purchase a
war-surplus Dakota.

On 1 April 1947 Bob returns to Manila to find the jointly owned Dakota
is missing. Suspecting an April Fools joke, Bob plays along, but becomes
concerned when the aircraft does not reappear. Bob does not confront
Walters, Instead, he discovers the location, and moves it himself to
another strip on the outskirts of Manila.

In mid August 1947, as Boedi is having a few beers at the AB Bar, Bob
Walters sits down and launches into a tirade about his business dealings
with Bob Freeberg.
