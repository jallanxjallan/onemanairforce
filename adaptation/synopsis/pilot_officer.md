status: fix up
synopsis: Muharto falsely identifies himself as co-pilot, thereby saving Bob from an infraction of Filipino aviation regulations. 
---
At the airport, authorities ignore the fictitious registration but ask Bob to identify his co-pilot, a requirement on international flights. Thinking quickly, Muharto steps forward and produces his Indonesian Air Force identification card. Assuming that the Filipinos are unfamiliar with Indonesian-language rank designations, he falsely translates his rank as "Pilot Officer". Bob gives Muharto a silent nod of thanks.
