title: On The Beach
---

Bob Freeberg lands his unmarked Dakota at night on on a remote beach in southwest Java. Villagers soon surround the aircraft. They are friendly and offer Bob and his two Filipino crew members food and a place to sleep. But the following morning, Indonesian soldiers appear. One points to the lack of registration on the Dakota's tail and shouts "Dutch Spy!". All point their rifles directly at Bob. He replies with the only Indonesian words he knows, a name: "Captain Petit Muharto"
