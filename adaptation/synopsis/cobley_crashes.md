Dutch forces entering Jambi spot RI-007 on the Batanghari river. Cobley and his mechanic are repairing an engine. Cobley spots the soldiers, slams shut the engine cowling, and the two climb into the cockpit. Cobley fires up the working engine and attempts to take off. The Catalina gets airborne, then banks and dives back into the river. Cobley swims to shore and runs into the forest.
