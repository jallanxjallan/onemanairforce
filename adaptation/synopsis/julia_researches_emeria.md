Intrigued by Victors stories of Emeria, Julia searches the stacks for articles mentioning her. Fluent in Dutch, Julia is able to read obscure news reports and journals in the Batavia press. A portrait emerges of an independent, charismatic young  woman whose mixed parentage of a Dutch businessman and a Javanese aristocrat, along with considerable artistic talent, grants her entry into all levels of Dutch and Indonesian society in Batavia.
