American freelance journalist Cameron Bishop calls on Petit Muharto in his Jakarta home to interview him about his experiences running the Dutch blockade with Bob Freeberg. Muharto begins with a surprise telephone message he received from Pang Suparto, an army officer, telling that a foreign pilot had made an emergency landing on a remote beach and was asking for Muharto by name.
