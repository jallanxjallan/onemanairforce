---
Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting
with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when
they hear the roar of a large motorcycle approaching. Muharto, in jest,
covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in
front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani
opens it to find Cameron Bishop, an engaging, disheveled young American, who says has an appointment to interview Muharto about his experiences with Bob Freeberg. 

Though Muharto had expected to be interviewed by a journalist, not a "Hells Angel", he invites Cameron to enter (though insisting he remove his motorcycle boots). After obligatory pleasantries, Muharto launches into his tales of running the blockade in Freeberg's ramshackle, war-surplus Dakota, beginning with a surprise telephone message he received from Pang Suparto, an army officer stationed in west Java, announcing that a foreign pilot had landed on a nearby beach and was asking for Muharto by name.
