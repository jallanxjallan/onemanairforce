Bob invites Muharto to join him for dinner at the Hotel Merdeka. Muharto is served a plate of rice and soy cake, the same as the other diners, some of whom are high officials. Bob wonders why he has not been served, and his bemusment turns into motification a few minutes later when the senior waiter, his dignity undi-
minished by his stained and frayed waistcoat, approached the tabel carrying a gleaming silver-service tray. With a graceful flourish,
the waiter set the tray on the table in front of Bob and whipped
off the cover, revealing steaming slices of freshly fried corned beef,
the contents of the single can left behind by visiting United Nations officials.
