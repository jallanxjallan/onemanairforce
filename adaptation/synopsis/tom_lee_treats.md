Boedi tells Cameron of the hardships they endured waiting to sell the quinine. He notes that they could count on Freebergs friend Tom Lee for a good meal and drinks, during which Lee would express a keen interest in the politics of the Republic. Boedi jokes that Lee was officially working as a VA lawyer, but might have been moonlighting with another government agency.
