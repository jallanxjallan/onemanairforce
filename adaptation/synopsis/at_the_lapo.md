Sabam invites Syd and Cameron for beer and pork at a lapo. Sabam gets a
little tipsy, and blurts out that he and Syd are working on a high-level
corruption story involving Army intelligence. Sabam is on the phone in
his office. He looks stricken as he replaces the handset in the cradle.
He then calls to Syd and Cameron to come with him to his favorite lapo,
a roadside eating and drinking stall a short walk from the Jakarta Post.
Sabam orders a round of beer, and tells Syd that Deppen just called. He
need say nothing more. Cameron looks confused. Syd explains that he and
Sabam had been chasing a story about senior military officers seeking to
drive up stock prices in advance of deregulation through claiming to
have "inside information" gathered through domestic intelligence
networks. Deppen is suspicious, and Sabam worries that they might try to
shut down the Post on a pretext. Sabam cautions his companions to be
cautious about what they write, or even say, from now on, as he
pointedly glances at Cameron.
