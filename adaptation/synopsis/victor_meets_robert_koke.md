Victor tells Cameron about the occasion when American consul general Walter Foote brought another American, Robert Koke, to meet Spoor. While they wait for Spoor to finish a telephone call, Koke remarks about the photographic equipment on Victors desk, saying that he had been a cinematographer in Hollywood before coming to Bali and opening a hotel catering A-list world travelers. Victor recounts this meeting to Emeria and friends a few days afterward. One of them recognizes Koke as an intelligence agent active in Java and Bali during the post-war operations to repatriate interned Americans.
