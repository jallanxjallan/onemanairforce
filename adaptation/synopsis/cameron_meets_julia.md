When Cameron enters the National Library reference section, the desk attendant summons Julia, an attractive, bookish Indonesian woman in her early twenties who usually assists foreign researchers because of her fluency in English and Dutch. Cameron explains his mission. Julia suggests that Cameron start with accounts written by Americans and Brits present in Indonesia at the time. Julia disappears into the stacks, soon emerging with an armful of books.
