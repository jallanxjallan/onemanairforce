title: Cameron Meets Julia 
date: 28 September 1988

Cameron does his research at the newly opened National Library, which maintains an archive of
newspapers dating back more than a century. Julia Suryakusuma, a bookish, attractive intern is assigned to assist Cameron because of her fluency in English and Dutch.
Cameron explains his mission, and Julia disappears into the stacks,
emerging a few minutes later with both bound newspaper collections and a
few English-language books from the adjacent reference section that she
thinks might be helpful. The newspaper articles corraborate most of the
events Muharto described. Skimming through the supplementary background material Julia selected, Cameron's attention is drawn to a passage in a
book by British diplomat John Coast about having a few drinks with
Freeberg in Bangkok.
