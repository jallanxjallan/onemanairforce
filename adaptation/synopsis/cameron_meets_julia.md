Cameron visits the National Library. Using his Jakarta Post credentials,
he is admitted to the limited-access reference section, an archive of
publications and books dating back to colonial times. The attendant on
duty is Julia, an attractive, bookish Indonesian woman in her early
twenties. She demonstrates an impressive competence when he gives her
the list of documents from Sabam. Julia disappears into the stacks and
reappears almost immediately with an armload of binders and books, which
she dumps on the reading table. As Cameron starts to read, Julia offers
to translate any Dutch-language clippings.
