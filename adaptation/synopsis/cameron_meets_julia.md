Cameron enters the National Library reference section, and the desk attendant summons Julia, an attractive, bookish Indonesian woman in her early twenties who usually assists foreign researchers because of her fluency in English and Dutch. Cameron explains his mission. Julia suggests that Cameron start with accounts written in English who had been present in Jogjakarta during the period. Julia disappears into the stacks, soon emerging with an armful of books and magazine articles.
