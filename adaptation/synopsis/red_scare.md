In early December 1988 Julia receives a letter from Florida. It is not
from Robert Koke, but a nephew. He explains that his uncle is reticent
about his days with the CIA, but he loves hearing the stories, so he
used Julia's letter as an excuse to ply his uncle with a few whiskeys
and hear the stories. It seems the nephew is a born storyteller himself,
and Julia is immediately drawn into the vivid descriptions of events in
post-war Batavia, at least those that are not still classified
intelligence, even 40 years on.

In mid June 1948 Cobley flies communists to Madiun

On 10 September 1948 Spoor orders a night patrol not to engage a
blockade running POAS flight because he is informed that American and
other civilians are passengers.
