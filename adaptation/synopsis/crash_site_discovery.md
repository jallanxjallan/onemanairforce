Two wiry men dressed in shabby clothes lead a squad of airmen
and their officer, Lt. Sulaiman, through a forested hillside to the
wreckage of RI-002. The airmen set up camp and search the area. They
find fragments of a wing with the faded letters: RI-00, other airplane
parts, including a dynamo with a bullet wedged between the windings and
armature. There are a few fragments of human remains, which the soldiers
reverently dig from the earth and carefully wrap in cloth. The also find
two empty wooden crates labeled: "Gold", but a thorough search of the
area does not find any trace of the treasure itself.
