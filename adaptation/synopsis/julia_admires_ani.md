As research continues, Cameron and Julia spend time with Petit and Ani
Muharto. As Cameron and Muharto discuss their progress and plan their
next moves, Julia takes notes and suggests avenues of research. But when
the conversation turns to speculation into CIA and Spoor planning a
coup, Julia drifts away and seeks out Ani. Julia listens, in awe, of Ani
recounting of life in Jogja during the revolution. Ani tells of her
growth from a naive teenager thinking only of making a household to a
committed champion of the people, volunteering to teach and to feed the
swelling population of refugees.
