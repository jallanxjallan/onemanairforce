title: Music for Seniors
status: new
---

One evening in late October 1988 at the Earthquake, the music is
supplied by a band playing keroncong, a guitar-driven genre that
features sentimental Dutch-language lyrics. Regarded as "music for old
folks" the audience of senior and retired military officers laps it up.
Afterward, Sanyoto introduces Syd and Cameron to Samuel Quiko, the band
leader. Sanyoto mentions that Samuel had been active in the revolution,
and might have interesting stories to tell.

When researching with Julia at the library in late October 1988, Cameron
mentions his meeting with Samuel Quiko. Julia recognizes the name, and
disappears into the stacks, reappearing with an armful of magazines
containing articles about keroncong. Julia sees that in several of the
photos Samuel is with Emeria. Julia suggests that they interview Samuel
Quiko. Cameron demurs, saying that a guy who plays "music for seniors"
would be of little value in investigating the fate of RI-002.

In mid October 1988, Julia goes alone to Kampung Tugu, a village on the
outskirts of Jakarta that is the home of keroncong, to interview Samuel
Quiko.

Samuel suggests that if Julia wants to know more about Emeria, she
should talk to Regina, Emiria's assistant who is now an artist in her
own right.
