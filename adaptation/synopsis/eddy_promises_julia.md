Colonel Eddy tells Julia of his guilt in not being able to fulfill the dreams of his only child. He tells Julia to start applying to universities in Europe and America. When Julia asks where the tuition money is coming from, Eddy holds up his hand and says: " Beres Sayang ", meaning she should not worry. Julia replies: " Asal aku nggak di jodohin ", as long as it does not involve an arranged marriage.
