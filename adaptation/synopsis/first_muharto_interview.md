# Cameron Meets Muharto

Cameron Bishop, a young American freelance
journalist living in Jakarta, interviews retired Air Force Major Petit
Muharto about his experiences during Indonesia's struggle for
independence from the Dutch in the years following the Pacific War.
Muharto tells Cameron that he had been the leader of blockade-running
missions by Bob Freeberg in his war-surplus Dakota registered to the new
Republic of Indonesia as RI-002. He begins his story by describing the surprising telephone call he received in Maguwo Air Base in Jogjakarta. 

# Muharto Meets Pang 

Muharto tells Cameron that he bid Freeberg farewell in Singapore and returned to Jogja some days later on VT-CLA. Two months later, Muharto flew into Tasik, meeting Pang Suparto, who confirmed that the pilot was indeed Bob Freeberg. Muharto and Pang loaded two barrels of aviation fuel into a jeep and drove to the beach where Bob was stranded.

# Crash Site Investigation

The crash site was only discovered in April 1977.
An investigation revealed no clue to the fate of the gold, and a few
unidentifiable human remains were gathered and buried with military
honors. 

# Muharto Regrets

Muharto tells Cameron that if he had
declined the promotion, as he had wished to do, and stayed with RI-002,
perhaps it would not have met such a tragic and mysterious fate.
