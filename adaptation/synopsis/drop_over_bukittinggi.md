The CALI Dakota flies over the Bukit Barisan mountaintops, and drops
into a valley toward the town of Bukittinggi. Bob passes low over an airstrip, which is  full of potholes and
so nunusable. The two other passengers, both uniformed soliders, are donning parachutes and preparing to jump. Bob ask Muharto to tell the soldiers that he must drop them at minimum height, else the high wind will carry them in the surrounding mountains. The co-pilot leaves his seat and goes to the cargo
compartment, motioning to Miss Brown and Muharto to sit down far from
the door. The co-pilot wrenches open the door, and scraps of paper and
cardboard swirl as the air stream enters the cabin. Bob flies low and slow over the airstrip, the aircraft shuddering on the verge of stalling, The soldiers jump, and Muharto sees their chutes open barely in time for a safe landing.
