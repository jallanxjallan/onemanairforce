title: Cameron Meets Victor
date: 11 October 1988

Cameron and Julia visit Victor at the Indonesian Photo Agency, or IPPHOS, which he manages. Victor  inllustrates his recollections of the time by finding and showing news photographs from 1947 and 1988. Candid shots of Spoor convey his frustration and fury at reports of RI-002 evading his blockade with impunity, and his bemusement to learn that a Republican aircraft that had crashed on a beach in Malaya was not smuggling guns, but common household wares. 

One of the photographs shows a beautiful, charismatic Indonesian woman standing before a painting. The caption reads: "Emeria Soenassa in her studio." Julia asks about her, but Victor is evasive, and shoves the photo back into a pile.
