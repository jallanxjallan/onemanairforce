Julia and Cameron enter the IPPHOS office, located on the ground floor of a building in the old sectin of Jakarta and one inspection away from being condemned. An ancient air conditioner wheezes over a window, barely reducing the heat and humidity. 

Victor, a slight, elderly man of sallow complexion, is the only person in the office and openly delighted at receiving company. Julia introduces Cameron and expalins the purpose of their visit. The negatives and prints are held in tattered folders placed on shelves seemingly at random, but Victor strides confidently to a shelf, pulls out a folder from the middle of a pile, and brings it back to the desk. He leafts through the folder and pulls out a strip of negatives showing a large American standing in front of an airplane. It is Bob Freeberg and RI-002. Victor repeats the process and shows Cameron images of Spoor in his office.
