Two days after the 1988 interview, Cameron faxes a draft of the
interview to Richard Beth, a grizzled Australian journalist living in Hong Kong since the end of the Pacific War. Richard grudgingly accepts the story for a Sunday-supplement magazine he
edits, but tells Cameron confirm as many details as he can through
contemporaneous news reports.
