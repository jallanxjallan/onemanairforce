In Jogjakarta, Suryadarma commissions Bob to fly a cargo of high-value quinine to Manila and return with essential medicines and spare parts. Muharto expresses concern about the reception that might await unmarked aircraft carrying high-value goods into Manila. He suggests that they paint a fictitious registration number onto the tail. After some debate, Muharto, Bob, and Suryadarma agree on "RI-002", reserving "RI-001" for a future presidential aircraft.
