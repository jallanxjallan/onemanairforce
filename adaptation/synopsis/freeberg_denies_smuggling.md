date: May 1948
---

Freeberg admits flying the Republican strategic stockpile of opium
from Jogjakarta to Bukittinggi. But he knows nothing about Indonesian opium
now showing up in the dens of Bangkok. Coast asks Bob about the condition of RI-002. Bob admits that the craft is suffering from the wear-and-tear of past months, especially repeated landings on rough jungle airstrips, and says he is waiting for the Indonesians to pay him the huge debt they owe so he can do the much-needed repairs. Coast tells Bob that he is welcome to fly for his company, POAS, if RI-002 becomes too dangerous. Bob thanks him, but insists that he will find a way to fix his beloved Dakota.
