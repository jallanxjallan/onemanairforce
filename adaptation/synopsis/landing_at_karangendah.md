The CALI Dakota circles a refurbished Japanese airstrip at Karangendah on the grasslands of south Sumatra. Muharto doubts that the strip can accommodate an aircraft of this size, but Bob replies that he did
this all the time in the war: "I can land on a dime and give you a
nickel change." 

Bob makes a spectacular landing, engines roaring with reverse thrust. Muharto asks if he can take off again. Bob replies:
"I hope so. We seem to be smack dab in the middle of nowhere." 

Santoso, the base commander climbs aboard to meet them.
After a short conversation, Santoso exits, and Bob takes off, the wheels
finally lifting off the runway a few meters before the end.
