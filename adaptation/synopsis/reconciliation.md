POAS.

In late September 1948 Boedi brings Freeberg and Muharto together over
whiskey to reconcile differences.

to Jogja under cover of darkness, Fowler believes he spots fighter
planes tailing him. His radio operator hears traffic on Dutch military
frequencies. When when Fowler looks again, the fighters are gone.

In September 1948 Suryadarma takes away Bob's fuel allowance for
undisclosed reasons.

Over whiskey with Fowler, Muharto, and Boedi at Hotel Merdeka in late

saying they want this or that but never follow through. He says that
many Indonesians (present company excepted) would cut off their nose to
spite their face.
