Leaving the Earthquake on evening in early December 1988, Cameron is
waylaid by Pemuda Pancasila thugs outside of the Earthquake. Sanyoto
appears, and whacks the leader on the nose with his cane.

In early December 1988 Sanyoto arranges meeting with Yapto, the head of
the Pemuda Pancasila. Yapto is affable, and expresses a sincere
apologize for the unpleasantness with his boys, which must have been a
case of mistaken identity. Yapto gives Cameron a signed business card to
show to any PP members who might threaten him in the future.
