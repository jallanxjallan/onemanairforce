title: Our Hotel In Bali
status: new
---

In mid October 1988, Julia reads a review in the Bali Post of a book
written by Louise Koke about her and her husband Robert running a hotel
in Bali in the 1930s. Julia finds *Our Hotel in Bali* in a newly opened
bookstore selling English-language books. The portrait of Robert Koke
that emerged from the book seemed totally at odds with the perception of
a CIA officer seeking to destabilize a regime. Julia tracks down a
Balinese employee mentioned in the book who went on to become a hotel
professional. He confirms the respect the Kokes held for the Balinese
and Indonesians in general, and supplies the name of an acquaintance who
encountered Koke in post-war Batavia.

In mid November 1988, Julia informs Cameron about Robert Koke. Cameron
dismisses her, saying that CIA agents are masters at dissemination.
Julia is annoyed and offended, but remains silent. Instead, she sends a
letter to Koke through the book's publisher, asking for more info about
his time in Batavia.
