Cameron visits to deliver extra copies of the magazine requested by Muharto. Muharto is beaming, friends have been phoning all morning from Manila and Bangkok. 

He tells Cameron that when he showed the article to his business colleagues, no one had heard of Freeberg. Muharto asks Cameron if he might help to solve the mystery so the services of Bob Freeberg are not lost to history. 
  Tells of frustration doing initial research in early 1980s. Military feigns ignorance. Libraries unorganized or zealously guarded.
The initial report by Sulaiman contained anomalies. Noted that a large group might have visited the site a few months previously. The few fragments of human remains could not be identified, and no gold was found.


Cameron tells Muharto that things have changed now. He was impressed with the new library, especially the grad student working there who seemed to be able to find anything.
