Julia and Cameron go to Jogja with Muharto and Ani. Julia contacts a
local reporter who had interviewed an elderly woman artist living on the
outskirts of Jogja, and is given the address of the person she suspects
to be Emiria.

Julia arrives at the address to find a woman seemingly in her 70s but
vivacious as a young girl teaching art to a room full of local children.
Emeria tells Julia that she regrets betraying Victor, but she had no
choice. "it was war. You have to choose sides."

Emilia tells Julia that after her husband died she could have stayed in
the Netherlands on a generous pension with European conveniences and
healthcare but instead she came back to Indonesia to teach art to young
kids to create themselves fully following the arena marsman technique.
At the end of the day she says to Julia you have to decide where you are
going to be the most useful
