# Cameron Meets Boediardjo

Muharto takes Cameron to a long-overdue reunion with Boediardjo, the
radio operator of RI-002. In his spacious salon, walls lined with an
extensive collection of European art and Indonesian masters, Boediardjo,
a short, heavy-set man in his early sixties, displays the Javanese
statesmans ideal of blending commanding authority with refined manners
and easy grace. The two old comrades revel in recounting their
experiences on RI-002, with Boediardjo filling in Cameron about missions
where Muharto was absent. He also recounts events that Muharto did not
mention, recalling Muharto's terror-stricken look during the November
1947 incident when Freeberg, who had flown through typhoons, dove into
the heart of a violent storm to evade a Dutch patrol.

# Boedi Offers Assistance

Shortly before leaving, Muharto converses with Boedi's wife, presenting her with a gift from his wife. Whiel they are alone, Boediardjo tells Cameron that his research is doing a service to both the air force and to Muharto personally, who needs to know the truth about the fate of their friend. He invites Cameron to keep him posted on the progress of his investigations.
