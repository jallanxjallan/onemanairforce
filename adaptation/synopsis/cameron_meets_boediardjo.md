Muharto takes Cameron to his long-delayed reunion with Boediardjo, the radio operator of RI-002. In his spacious salon, walls lined with an extensive collection of European art and Indonesian masters, Boediardjo, a short, heavy-set man in his late sixties displays the Javanese statesmans ideal of blending commanding authority with refined manners and easy grace. The two old comrades revel in recounting their experiences on RI-002, with Boediardjo gently ribbing Muharto about misadventures, such as setting the flaps incorrectly on his first attempt at landing RI-002.
