Cameron spends the weekend at Simbolon, and attends a casual beach barbeque where Yapto is the cook. The food is plentiful, and delicious, and Yapto a charming host, though vulgar and sexist. At Fahmis prompting, Yapto tells the story of his encounter with PP thugs. Yapto apologizes, insists that it must have been a misunderstanding. Yapto gives Cameron his business card, signs the back with a distinguishable flourish, and tells him to show it to any PP member who threatens him. He can also use the card to seek the assistance of PP members anywhere in Indonesia. Cameron metions that, indeed, he will be traveling to Palembang in a few days. Yapto tells him to contact his old friend, Anwar Congo.
