Muharto and Cameron travel to Jogjakarta to view the
pieces of wreakage retrieved from the crash site now stored at the
Aviation Museum there. When Muharto handles a dynamo which,
incongruously has a bullet wedged in the windings, he falls into trance
and is tranported back to the cockpit of RI-002 on the day in October
1948 when it crashed into the Sumatran mountainside.
