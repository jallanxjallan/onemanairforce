Cameron and Muharto visit the widow and son of Santoso. Hadi Santoso tells attending the heros funeral, and taking his fathers necklace from casket when guards back was turned. When Muharto examines the necklace, he again falls into a trance. This time seems to be sitting in the co-pilot seat of RI-002. Looking to his left, he sees a vague image of someone smaller than Bob in the captains chair.
