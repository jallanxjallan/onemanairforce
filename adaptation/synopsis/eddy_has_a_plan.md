title: Eddy Has A Plan
status: new

In 10 November 1988, Eddy tells Julia that he is determined to fulfill
the dream of his only child to study overseas. Julia reminds him that
his nickname is "Honest Eddy" and that his only income is his military
wage. Eddy replies that he is making arrangements. Julia is doubtful,
but agrees to go along with whatever he plans, as long as it is not an
arranged marriage to some rich brat.

On the evening of 11 November 1988, Julia is sitting in a restaurant
with Eric, a young Indonesian man of good family. Eric mentions his
surprise Julia's mother phoned his mother to suggest he take her to
dinner. Eric dominates the conversation, insisting, with the
authoritative confidence typical of the offspring of new wealth, how he
is an essential component in the business deal that their respective
fathers are cooking up. Julia wants more details about this "business
deal", but decides it would be better to remain silent.
