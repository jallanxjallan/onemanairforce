title: Muharto Runs Guns

At a party in Manila in mid April 1948, Muharto is appalled when one of
Bob's housemates boasts of shooting down own squad leader. He decides to
not tell Bob of his plan to smuggle gems into Manila to be traded for
sidearms. He arranges for Filipino commandos to enter RI-002 and
retrieve the gems from a concealed niche. The following morning, Bob
notices that the cockpit had been disturbed, and confronts Muharto.

In mid March 1948 Muharto and Bambang argue over who gets to sit in the
right-hand seat of RI-002.

In mid April 1948 Bambang cannot conceal his envy of Moeljono when his
fellow aviator flies the twin-engine RI-005 Avro-anson from Bukittinggi
to Jogjakarta.
