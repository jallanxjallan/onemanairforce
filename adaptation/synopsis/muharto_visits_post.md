On 2 October 1988, the day after the article is published, Muharto
visits The Jakarta Post to personally thank Sabam and Cameron. He says
he he has been bombarded with calls from old Air Force comrades, asking
about what happened to the gold. Muharto admits that he had tried to
solve the mystery himself, but had gotten nowhere.

In May 1980 Muharto enters a decrepit building housing stacks of
books...

Syd Jardine says that since unloading a quarter ton of gold would
require considerable resources, discovering who might have had the
motivation and ability to transport and sell the gold could solve the
mystery of RI-002. Muharto agrees, and Cameron eagerly offers to help.
He tells Muharto that he knows just the person who could help them do
the research.
