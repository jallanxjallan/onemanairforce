The day after the article is published, Muharto visits the Jakarta Post
office to thank his good friend Sabam personally. He then goes to
Cameron at his desk to thank him as well, and ask if he wanted to write
more articles on the subject. Cameron demurs, not interested in digging
further into history. Then his phone rings. On the line is Julia,
phoning to congratulate him and to offer her services as researcher if
he wants to further investigate the Freeberg story. Cameron grins, looks
to Muharto and says: "I'm in"
