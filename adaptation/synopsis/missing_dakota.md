In what he initially suspects to be an April Fool's joke, on his return to Manila Bob discovers that the jointly owned Dakota is missing. Bob does not confront his partner directly, but instead makes discreet inquiries. He is directed to a small airfield on the outskirts of Manila. He relocates the disputed aircraft himself, choosing another airfield with a short runway hemmed in by houses. Only a pilot with Bobs exceptional skill could land a large Dakota there.
