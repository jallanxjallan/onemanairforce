[Bob Lands On Beach](../synopsis/bob_lands_on_beach.md)

[Cameron Meets Muharto](../synopsis/cameron_meets_muharto.md)

[Surprise Call](../synopsis/surprise_call.md) 

Muharto tells Cameron that this aircraft, a Nikosoren, was one of a score of aircraft the Japanese left behind as not-airworthy. The air force mechanics kept the aircraft flying through skill and guesswork, but Muharto was aware that any flight could end in disaster. To keep his mind from this fate, Muharto had thought about the American pilots he had met during the blockade runs he had organized from Singapore to Jogjakarta. He had decided that only Bob Freeberg possessed the skill and nerve to land at night on a narrow beach. Bob had been the pilot of the third blockade run. Though these had been standard charter flights -- they even had a flight attendant, a lovely Filipina named Miss Brown -- the third flight would test the skills of any aviator.  

[Third Cali Run](../synopsis/third_cali_run.md) 

Muharto tells Cameron that he spent the next minutes desperately trying to remember if the tracks tunnel through any mountains along the route. In fact, the mountain ridges were behind them, and they landed in Jogjakarta without incident. 

[Bob Meets Suryadarma](../synopsis/bob_meets_suryadarma.md)

Muharto tells Cameron that he was pleased at this display of crucial international support, but dismayed that once again he will be desk-bound. However, this last fight would prove to be memorable, as Suryadarma had asked Bob to make a couple of detours on the way back to Singapore, risky activities more suited to a military mission that a civilian charter flight. Nonetheless, Bob had cheerfully agreed.

[Drop Over Bukittinggi](../synopsis/drop_over_bukittinggi.md)

Muharto tells Cameron he bid Freeberg farewell in Singapore and returned
to Jogja some days later on VT-CLA. Two months later, Muharto flew into
Tasik, meeting Pang Suparto, who confirmed that the pilot was indeed Bob
Freeberg. They loaded two barrels of aviation fuel into a jeep and drove
to the beach.

[Pilot Officer](../synopsis/pilot_officer.md)  

Muharto tells Cameron that they awoke the next morning to find they were celebrities, with several newspapers giving front-page treatment to RI-002 and the "Javanese Crew". This also, of course attracted the attention of Dutch diplomats, who not only laid claim to the cargo of quinine, but to Muharto and his comrades who were, they claimed "Subjects of the Queen". The Dutch sued in civil court for possession of the quinine. Fortunately, Muharto's celebrity status also attracted the attention of Salipada Penatun, a sitting Senator as well as a practising lawyer, whose family had close cultural ties to Indonesia, and so offered his services pro bono.  

[Quinine Case](../synopsis/quinine_case.md) 

Muharto tells Cameron that the verdict took six weeks to deliver. But finally, on the morning of 29 July, the judge ruled in favor of the Republicans. Bob invited his crew to his apartment that evening to celebrate their victory, but a radio news bulleting cast  a pall on the evening. 

[VT-CLA Crashes](../synopsis/vt-cla_crashes.md)  

Muharto tells Cameron that they finally sold the quinine and returned to Jogja in late September. For the rest of the year, he flew with Bob on RI-002 almost every day, connecting far-flung Republican bases with Jogja, and with Singapore, Bangkok, and Manila. 

[Republican Lifeline](../synopsis/republican_lifeline.md)



The people of Jogja regarded the modest and unassuming American as a hero, often leading to embarrassing situations, such as when he invited Muharto to dine with him at the Hotel Merdeka, where he stayed in Jogja. 

[Last Corned Beef](../synopsis/last_corned_beef.md)

Muharto tells Cameron that Bob's createst service to the Republic was flying top officials and techocrats to a United Nation's conference in the Philippines, where they successfully made the case for Indonesian independence. 

[Mission To Baguio](../synopsis/mission_to_bagiuo.md) 

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew with RI-002 until May 1948, when he was promoted to major and posted to headquarters. He saw little of Bob after that, but was looking for forward to having Bob as guest of honor at this wedding in October. But on 1 October, Muharto heard reports that RI-002 had been lost while transporting a large cargo of gold to Bukittinggi. The Dutch denied any knowledge of the disappearance, and the Republic was unable to mount more than a cursory search. Two farmers stumbled upon wreckage on a remote mountaintop in 1977, and the Air Force investigated the site. Muharto, long retired, only heard of this some years later. But as a former officer, he as permitted to access Air Force archives, where he found the investigation report.  

[Crash Site Discovery](../synopsis/crash_site_discovery.md)

[Sixth Coffin](../synopsis/sixth_coffin.md) 

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bobs
remains, could not be buried with the others because he was a foreigner.
Muharto's expression as he finishes his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. As Cameron rises to leave, Muharto wonders that if he had turned down promotion and had been with Bob on the final flight, maybe it would not have ended in tragedy.
