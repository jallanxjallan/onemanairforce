# Logline

A struggling young American journalist and an Indonesian college
student, both craving personal and professional freedom, come together
to solve the mysterious disappearance of an American blockade runner.
Their journey of discovery takes them from the danger and privation of a
nation under siege to the glittering social scene of a colonial capital,
and ends with the realization of what freedom really means.

# Introducing Cameron and Muharto

In 1988 in Jakarta, Cameron Bishop, an engaging, disheveled
young American, toiling away as proofreader at an English-language
newspaper, interviews retired Indonesian Air Force Major Petit Muharto
about his blockade-running missions with American naval veteran Bob
Freeberg during Indonesia\'s
post-war struggle for independence.

As the story unfolds, Cameron realizes that the tales of this
free-booting adventurer, and the mystery of the last flight, when
Freeberg and his aircraft, designated RI-002, vanished while carrying a ton of gold bullion to
Sumatra ahead of a feared Dutch invasion of Jogjakarta, was worth a
book, not just a newspaper article. Cameron and Muharto agree to
collaborate to investigate the mystery and write a book that would jump-start the ambitious young
journalist\'s career, bring a sense of closure to a veteran freedom
fighter haunted by his past, and to grant a forgotten hero his due
recognition. 

# Introducing Julia

Cameron's workmate Syd Jardine, an alcoholic, veteran foreign
correspondent washed up in Jakarta cautions against Freeberg being
portrayed as a \"white savior\" who singlehandedly saved the nation. Syd advises Cameron to begin his research in the historical archives of the National Library to gain a comprehensive familiarity of the time and place. At the library, Cameron enlists the assistance of Julia Suryakusuma, an attractive,
bookish woman in her early 20s, interning there while
she finishes her degree. Julia dreams of escaping her loving, but
parochial military family, who are pressuring her to marry a suitable
boy, by obtaining a scholarship to pursue a post-graduate degree overseas. 

# Introducing Victor

Julia, in turn,
introduces Cameron to Victor de Jong, a slight, elderly man who manages
a photo agency archive and consults for the library. As a Dutch
conscript, Victor had worked at KNIL headquarters, and after
independence had stayed on and taken Indonesian citizenship. Victor
provides a first-hand portrayal of General Simon Spoor, the commanding
officer of KNIL, the colonial military force, battling the free-booting
pilots. Though this research, a portrait emerges of a courageous and
exceptionally skilled pilot who nonetheless was in serious financial
difficulty. 

# Introducing Emeria

Victor also reveals another side. A talented artist and photographer, in
his off-duty hours Victor participated photographing and writing reviews
of art exhibitions and society gatherings where no one, save his
flamboyant friend and fellow artist Auke Sonnega, knew he was a
active-duty soldier. Julia notices a photo of a strikingly beautiful
Indonesian woman in her late twenties who, though dressed in baggy,
paint-splattered overalls, radiates elegance and poise. The caption
reads \"Emeria Soenassa in her studio, 1948\". Julia asks Victor who she
is. Victor replies \"No one important\", snatches the photo from the
table and files it away. Julia's curiosity about Emeria leads her into
the glittering social scene of post-war Batavia, introducing her to a
charismatic, highly intelligent figure, the first female Indonesian
painter of modern art, whose salon had been a nexus of support for the
struggle for independence, where Dutch and Indonesian artists and
art-lovers met as equals.

# Introducing Sanyoto 

At his favorite bar, the Earthquake, Syd introduces Cameron to the owner, Sanyoto, a friend and former reporting source. Sanyoto had been a drill
sergeant in the Air Force, then worked as a fixer for foreign oil
companies. Sanyoto maintains wide
contacts in the highest levels of government and the military, who all regard him with great respect, so the
Earthquake is popular with generals and cabinet ministers. Sanyoto is delighted to hear of the investigation into the RI-002 mystery, and allows Cameron to interview his guests as long as he minds his manners.

# Introducing Samuel Quiko

Sanyoto introduces Cameron to Samuel Quiko, the leader of a band playing
*keroncong*, whose lilting melodies and sentimental Dutch-language
lyrics are adored by the older patrons. When Cameron mentions meeting
Samuel to Julia, she disappears into the stacks, emerging with a
magazine containing a photograph of a young Samuel with Emeria. But
Cameron dismisses the idea of interviewing Samuel, saying someone who
plays \"music for seniors\" is not relevant to their investigation. So
Julia travels to Kampung Tugu on the outskirts of Jakarta to interview
Samuel. Julia learns the Samuel\'s people, the Mardijikers, had been
persecuted by youth militias as \"brown Dutchmen\" during the struggle.
Samuel had secured protection for the Mardijikers by using his ability
as a keroncong musician to be an accepted presence in both Batavia elite
gatherings and Republican neighborhoods to transport guns and other
contraband under the noses of Dutch street patrols.

# Bibit Bebet Bobot

Julia's father, Colonel Eddy, disapproves of her relationship with a Harley-riding
foreigner with a sketchy job and unrealistic dreams. Eddy promises send Julia to post-graduate school in Germany, though Julia knows would be
impossible on his military income. But an arranged date with the son of
a family friend leads Julia to suspect that their respective fathers are
cooking up a corrupt business deal.

# Fights with Suryadarma

During his tenure in the Air Force, Muharto was constantly at odds with Suryadarma. Muharto had joined the Air Force to fly, but Suryadarma believed that the Dutch-educated, polylingual Muharto was most useful in an administrative position.  Freeberg and the other blockade runners also had their run-ins with Suryadarma, as he insisted on treating them as active-duty military officers under his direct command, not independent civilian aviation-service providers. 

# CIA Coup

Oblique, ambiguous comments in interviews and historical
accounts convince Muharto and Cameron that General Simon Spoor had been
plotting with the American consul-general and an agent of the newly
formed CIA to foment a military coup to forestall an inevitable handover
of the Netherlands East Indies to the Indonesians. Muharto agrees wholeheartedly with Cameron. In the Air Force, Muharto had suspected many senior officers of being clandestine communists attempting to undermine the nationalist Republican leaders. Breaking
the story of an attempted coup a decade before Vietnam would be Cameron's ticket to a high-profile journalistic career, and he and Muharto both descend a conspiracy rabbit hole, with each new discovery interpreted to support their conjecture. 

# Krokodil Kurier

Samuel plays a vital role in the resistance listening to conversations at Dutch social events and reporting back to the Republicans. 

# Black Flights

In April 1948, Suryadarma orders Freeberg to transport tons of opium to Bukittinggi. Though, in the eyes of the Republic, this was the legitimate relocation of a controlled substance from one government facility to another, if intercepted, the Dutch would regard Freeberg as a narcotics smuggler. But Freeberg had no choice: the Republic owned him large amounts, which he might never see if he were to start refusing missions. But his other business venture, Southeastern Airlines, was failing to take off, so to speak, and Freeberg was in danger of losing his investment.    

# Up The Rabbit Hole

Julia systematically unravels Cameron and Muharto\'s grand conspiracy
with her own research. She discovers that Robert Koke had operated a
\"bohemian chic\" hotel in Bali before the war and had been clearly
sympathetic to the Indonesia desire for self-determination. She finds
indications that Spoor\'s secretive meetings with American officials
were to share information about possible gunrunning by corrupt KNIL
officers. The most damning revelation was that Muharto had been the
commanding officer of a CIA-sponsored air force during the Permesta
rebellion of 1957. Seeing his prospects of a major book deal
evaporating, Cameron rejects Julia\'s conclusions.

# Finding Emeria

Julia learns of Regina Maya, an artist who, as a teenager, was Emeria\'s
domestic helper and credits her boss as the inspiration to pursue an
artistic career herself. Regina reveals that Victor and Emeria had been
lovers. When Julia confronts Victor with this information, he confesses
that he actually had defected to the Republican guerilla forces on the promise that
Emeria would join him, but he had not seen her again. Julia 
tracks down Emeria to a village near Jogjakarta, where she teaches art
to children. After independence, Emeria had been granted a \"colonial
guilt\" scholarship to study in the Netherlands for a year, but had met and married a Dutch academic and settled there. She only returned to Indonesia after her husband\'s
death a few years previously. Emeria regrets her decision to abandon Indonesia, but had been drawn to the promise of a stimulating life in Europe as an artist and the wife of a prominent college professor.

# Raid on Karangendah 

In December 1988, Julia finds a photograph of RI-002 guarded by a
Dutch soldier. Based on the surrounding landscape, Muharto believes the airstrip to be Karangendah. Cameron flies to Palembang to confirm this theory, but is denied access to the base, now an Army tank-training ground. Sanyoto arranges for Cameron to meet Anwar Congo, a local preman who he had used to fix problems. Anwar helps Cameron sneak into the base and take photographs. Later, Anwar reveals that he had organized the clandestine shipment of guns purchased with gold bullion by KNIL officers to Bukittinggi, confirming the conclusion Julia reached through her own research.   

# Cameron deported

Cameron returns to Jakarta, but Julia and her father are waiting at his rooming house.  Colonel Eddy informs Cameron that he had been spotted at Karangendah, and will shortly be identified. Eddy gives Cameron a ticket for a flight to the United States leaving in a few hours. At the airport, Cameron offers to send for Julia and marry her, but Julia says she would prefer to take her post-graduate degree in Indonesia.
