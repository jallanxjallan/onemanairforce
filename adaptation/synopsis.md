## Cameron Learns Story 

[Cameron Meets Muharto](scenes/cameron_meets_muharto.md)

Cameron Bishop, an American journalism student interning at the Jakarta Post, calls on retired Air Force Major Petit Muharto to interview him about his experiences flying blockade runs with Bob Freeberg in his war-surplus Dakota registered to the new Republic of Indonesia as RI-002.  Muharto begins with the surprising message he received at his desk at Maguwo air base in Jogjakarta.

Muharto tells Cameron that on his flight to Tasikmalaya, he wondered which of the blockade-running pilots he might be, The first two had been routine commercial runs, with even a flight attendent. Then his thoughts drifted to the last, and most eventful, blockade run two months before.

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew with RI-002 until May 1948, when he was promoted to major and posted to headquarters. Muharto saw little of Bob after that, but was looking for forward to having Bob as guest of honor at this wedding in October. But on 1 October, Muharto heard reports that RI-002 had been lost while transporting a large cargo of gold to Bukittinggi. The Dutch denied any knowledge of the disappearance, and the Republic was unable to mount more than a cursory search. Two farmers stumbled upon wreckage on a remote mountaintop in 1977, and the Air Force investigated the site. Muharto, long retired, only heard of this some years later. But as a former officer, he as permitted to access Air Force archives, where he found the investigation report.
