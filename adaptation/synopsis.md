# Introducing Cameron and Muharto

In **1988** in Jakarta, CAMERON BISHOP, an engaging, disheveled
young American toiling away as proofreader at an English-language
newspaper, interviews retired Indonesian Air Force Major PETIT MUHARTO
about his blockade-running missions with American naval veteran BOB
FREEBERG during Indonesia's
post-war struggle for independence. Muharto tells Cameron a story largely unknown in modern Indonesia: gripping tales transporting medicine and other essential goods in Freeberg's war-surplus cargo airplane, RI-002, while evading Dutch fighters, and how the Indonesians venerated Freeberg to the point of embarrassing this modest Kansas farm boy. Muharto concludes with the enduring mystery of the last flight, when
RI-002 vanished while carrying a ton of gold bullion to
Sumatra ahead of an expected Dutch invasion of Jogjakarta. 

# White Savior

The positive reaction to the published article and intense interest in the fate of the gold cargo convinces Cameron that the tales of this
free-booting adventurer deserve more than a newspaper article. He and Muharto agree to join forces to investigate the mystery of RI-002, and grant a forgotten hero his due
recognition. Cameron's workmate SYD JARDINE, an alcoholic, veteran foreign
correspondent washed up in Jakarta, agrees to consult on the project, and begins by cautioning against Freeberg being
portrayed as a "white savior" who singlehandedly saved the nation. Syd advises Cameron to start his research in the historical archives of the National Library to gain a comprehensive familiarity of the time and place. 

# Introducing Julia

Cameron enlists the assistance of JULIA SURYAKUSUMA, an attractive,
bookish young woman interning at the library while
finishing her degree undergraduate degree at the neighboring Univerity of Indonesia. Julia dreams of escaping her loving, but
parochial military family, who are pressuring her to marry a suitable
boy, by obtaining a scholarship to pursue a post-graduate degree overseas. Julia expertly extracts the material Cameron needs from the stacks, and sight-translates excerpts from Dutch-language books and newspapers. Cameron discovers that two other foreign pilots, American DAVE FOWLER and Australian RICHARD COBLEY,  <Need to finish this> 

# Introducing Victor

The tone of articles in the Batavia newspapers in the weeks after the disappearance suggest to Julia that the colonial military, the KNIL, knew more than they were letting on. So, Julia introduces Cameron to VICTOR DE JONG, a slight, elderly man who manages
a photo agency archive and consults for the library. As a Dutch
conscript, Victor had worked at KNIL headquarters, and after
independence had stayed on and taken Indonesian citizenship. Victor
provides a first-hand portrayal of GENERAL SIMON SPOOR, the commanding
officer of KNIL, the colonial military force, battling the free-booting
pilots. The hundreds of thousands of images in the IPPHOS photo archives shed light on much more than Spoor's fight against the blockade runners. The photos documenting daily life in post-war Batavia spark Victor's "photographic memory" into providing vivid descriptions of life in properous post-war Batavia, while others depict, in the stark contrast, the privations endured by the residents of the Republican capital of Jogyakarta, <finish this> 

# Introducing Emeria

The most surprising images for Cameron, and Julia and as well, were of the vibrant culture scene. A talented artist himself, in
his off-duty hours Victor photographed exhibitions and wrote astute newspaper reviews of the artists, many of whom were staunch Republicans not afraid to depict the horrors of the struggle to their oppressors. No one, save his
flamboyant friend and fellow artist AUKE SONNEGA, realized that Victor was a
active-duty soldier. Julia notices a photo of a strikingly beautiful
Indonesian woman in her late twenties who, though dressed in baggy,
paint-splattered overalls, radiates elegance and poise. The caption
reads "EMERIA SOENASSA in her studio, 1948". Julia asks Victor who she
is. Victor replies "No one important", snatches the photo from the
table and files it away. 

# Introducing Sanyoto 

At his favorite bar, the Earthquake, Syd introduces Cameron to the owner, SANYOTO, a long-time friend and former reporting source. Sanyoto had been a drill
sergeant in the Air Force, then worked as a fixer for foreign oil
companies. Sanyoto maintains wide
contacts in the highest levels of government and the military, who all regard him with great respect, so the
Earthquake is popular with generals and cabinet ministers. Sanyoto is delighted to hear of the investigation into the RI-002 mystery, and allows Cameron to interview his guests as long as he minds his manners.

# Researching Emeria

Julia's curiosity about Emeria leads her into
the glittering social scene of post-war Batavia, introducing her to a
charismatic, highly intelligent figure, the first female Indonesian
painter of modern art, whose salon had been a nexus of support for the
struggle for independence, where Dutch and Indonesian artists and
art-lovers met as equals.

# Introducing Samuel Quiko

Julia meets SAMUEL QUIKO, the leader of a band playing
*keroncong*, whose lilting melodies and sentimental Dutch-language
lyrics are adored by older Indonesians. During the struggle, Samuel's people, the Mardijkers, slaves freed during the 17th century and relocated to Kampung Tugu on the outskirts of Jakarta, had been
persecuted by youth militias as "brown Dutchmen".
Samuel had secured protection for the Mardijkers by using his ability
as a keroncong musician to be an accepted presence in both Batavia elite
gatherings and Republican neighborhoods to transport guns and other
contraband under the noses of Dutch street patrols. Through Samuel's recollections, Julia is transported to the glittering social scene of post-war Batavia: the vibrant art world of the Kuntskring art's club, where Dutch sympathizers and Republic artists met and mingled.  

# Bibit Bebet Bobot

Julia's father, COLONEL EDDY, disapproves of her relationship with a Harley-riding
foreigner with a sketchy job and unrealistic dreams. Eddy promises send Julia to post-graduate school in Germany, though Julia knows would be
impossible on his military income. But an arranged date with the son of
a family friend leads Julia to suspect that their respective fathers are
cooking up a corrupt business deal.

# Fights with Soerjadarma

During his tenure in the Air Force, Muharto was constantly at odds with SOERJADI SOERJADARMA. Muharto had joined the Air Force to fly, but Soerjadarma believed that the Dutch-educated, multilingual Muharto was most useful in an administrative position. Freeberg and the other blockade runners also had their run-ins with Soerjadarma, as he insisted on treating them as active-duty military officers under his direct command, not independent civilian aviation-service providers. 

# CIA Coup

Oblique, ambiguous comments in interviews and historical
accounts convince Muharto and Cameron that Spoor had been
plotting with the American consul-general and an agent of the newly
formed CIA to foment a military coup to forestall an inevitable handover
of the Netherlands East Indies to the Indonesians. Muharto agrees wholeheartedly with Cameron. Muharto had suspected many senior Air Force officers of being clandestine communists attempting to undermine the nationalist Republican leaders. Breaking
the story of an attempted coup a decade before Vietnam would be Cameron's ticket to a high-profile journalistic career, and would vindicate Muharto. They descend into a conspiracy rabbit hole, with each new discovery selectively interpreted to support their conjecture. 

# Black Flights

In **April 1948**, Soerjadarma orders Freeberg to transport tons of opium to Bukittinggi. Though, in the eyes of the Republic, this was the legitimate relocation of a controlled substance from one government facility to another, if intercepted, the Dutch would regard Freeberg as a narcotics smuggler. But Freeberg had no choice: the Republic owned him large amounts, which he might never see if he were to start refusing missions. But his other business venture, Southeastern Airlines, was failing to take off, so to speak, and Freeberg was in danger of losing his investment.    

# Up The Rabbit Hole

Julia systematically unravels Cameron and Muharto's grand conspiracy
with her own research. She discovers that Spoor's secretive meetings with American officials
were to share information about possible gunrunning by corrupt KNIL
officers. The most damning revelation was that Muharto had been the
commanding officer of a CIA-sponsored air force during the Permesta
rebellion of 1957. Seeing his prospects of a major book deal
evaporating, Cameron rejects Julia's conclusions.

# Finding Emeria

An interview with Emeria's teenage housekeeper, now an artist herself, reveals that Victor and Emeria had been
lovers. Julia confronts Victor with this information, who then confesses
that he actually had defected to the Republican guerrilla forces on the promise that
Emeria would join him, but he had not seen her again. Julia 
tracks down Emeria to a village near Jogjakarta, where she teaches art
to children. After independence, Emeria had been granted a "colonial
guilt" scholarship to study in the Netherlands for a year, but had met and married a Dutch academic and settled in Europe. She only returned to Indonesia after her husband's
death a few years previously. Emeria regrets her decision to abandon Indonesia, but had been drawn to the promise of a stimulating life in Europe as an artist and the wife of a prominent college professor.

# Raid on Karangendah 

In **December 1988**, Julia finds a photograph of RI-002 guarded by a
Dutch soldier. Based on the surrounding landscape, Muharto believes the airstrip to be Karangendah. Cameron flies to Palembang to confirm this theory, but is denied access to the base, now an Army tank-training ground. Sanyoto arranges for Cameron to meet Anwar Congo, a local preman who he had used to fix problems. Anwar helps Cameron sneak into the base and take photographs. Later, Anwar reveals that he had organized the clandestine shipment of guns purchased with gold bullion by KNIL officers to Bukittinggi, confirming the conclusion Julia reached through her own research.   

# Cameron deported

Cameron returns to Jakarta, but Julia and her father are waiting at his rooming house.  Colonel Eddy informs Cameron that he had been spotted at Karangendah, and will shortly be identified. Eddy gives Cameron a ticket for a flight to the United States leaving in a few hours. At the airport, Cameron offers to send for Julia and marry her, but Julia says she would prefer to take her post-graduate degree in Indonesia.
