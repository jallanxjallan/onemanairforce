Freeberg.

=========================================

Cameron meets Muharto, a dapper, energetic Indonesian man in his late
sixties, at his tidy residence in a Jakarta suburb. Muharto recounts his
exploits in RI-002 in such vivid detail that Cameron can clearly
visualize the events Muharto is describing starting with a surprise
telephone call he received at Maguwo Airbase in Jogjakarta on June 1947.

landed on a remote beach and has said his name. Suryadarma, the Air
Force commander, orders him to Tasik to investigate.

7 June 1947 --- In the air
==========================

Flying to Tasik in a refurbished Japanese aircraft, whose pilot had only
first seen an airplane a few months previously, Muharto takes his mind
from possible catastrophe by recollecting his experiences during his
blockade runs three months previously, wondering which pilot it might
be.

31 March 1947 --- CALI aircraft cockpit
=======================================

On the third blockade run, with Bob Freeberg as captain, the overcast
sky forces Muharto to navigate by asking Bob to fly low enough to follow
the railway line to Jogja.

31 March 1947 --- Maguwo airfield
=================================

In Jogja, Muharto introduces Bob to Suryadarma, who thanks the American
for his assistance, and asks him to perform some risky tasks on the
return leg. Bob grins and readily agrees.

31 March 1947 --- Karangendah Airfield
======================================

Muharto asks Bob to make a test landing on a refurbished wartime
airstrip designed for smaller aircraft such as fighters. Bob happily

8 June 1947 --- Tasik Army Base
===============================

In Tasik Muharto meets Pang Soeparto, the junior army officer who
telephoned him, who takes him (and two barrels of aviation fuel) to the
beach at Cikolong. As soon as Muharto sees the beach, bookended by two
rivers and the gap between the water and palm trees scarcely more than
the Dakota's wing span, he knew that, of all the pilots he had met, only
Bob Freeberg had the skill to make that landing.

9 June 1947 --- Cikolong Beach
==============================

Bob tells Muharto that his Dakota is stuck in the soft sand. Muharto
rallies the hundreds of villagers who have gathered for the spectacle of
the foreigner and his giant aircraft to tear apart their houses and use
the woven bamboo walls as a makeship runway. The Dakata takes off with
Muharto on board and heads to Jogja.

9 June 1947 --- Maguwo Airfield Jogja
=====================================

In Jogja, Suradarma commissions Bob to fly a cargo valuable quinine to

registration number, RI-002, on the unregistered war-surplus Dakota.

=====================================

Freeberg, Muharto and Boedi fly Republican officials to Manila to meet
with United Nations representatives in the hill town of Bagiou. The

cosmopolitan backgrounds, treat Bob with as much respect as do the
hero-worshipping common people of Jogja.

28 September 1988 --- Muhartos Living Room
==========================================

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew with RI-002 until May 1948, when he
was promoted to Major and assigned to a desk at headquarters. He saw
little of Bob after that, but was looking forward to having Bob as guest
of honor at his wedding in October. But three weeks before the wedding
he was devasted to learn that RI-002 had vanished on a mission.

28 September 1988 --- Muhartos living room
==========================================

Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash
site, wholly by accident, some five years previously. He wrote to his
contacts in the Air Force and to the officers who participated in the
crash-site investigation, but received vague, non-committal replies ---

of the coffins and place them on the truck. But they leave the sixth
coffin where it lies as the truck pulls away.

28 September 1988 --- Muhartos Living Room
==========================================

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob's
remains, could not be buried with the others as a foreigner cannot be
interred in a cemetery for national heroes, however much he may deserve
the honor himself through his services to the nation.

Muharto's expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces Cameron
that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking closure
about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying,
wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of
RI-002 than they are telling.
