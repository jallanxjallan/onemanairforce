# Episode 1

[Bob Lands On Beach](synopsis/bob_lands_on_beach.md) 

On an evening in  **June 1947**, Bob Freeberg lands his unmarked Dakota cargo plane on a remote beach in southwest Java. Republican soldiers arrive and threaten to shoot him as a Dutch spy. He pleads for his life with the only Indonesian words he knows: "Kapten Petit Muharto." 

[Cameron Meets Muharto](synopsis/cameron_meets_muharto.md) 

in **September 1988**, Cameron Bishop, a young American freelance journalist living in Jakarta, interviews retired Air Force Major Petit Muharto about his experiences during Indonesia's struggle for independence from the Dutch in the years following the Pacific War. Muharto tells Cameron that he had been the leader of blockade running missions by Bob Freeberg in his war-surplus Dakota registered to the new Republic of Indonesia as RI-002. As Muharto unspools his tales, Cameron is taken back to that beach on June 1947, where Muharto found Freeberg, who he had met in previous blockade run and convinced the local villagers to weave hundreds of bamboo mats for an improvised runway. For the rest of 1947 and into 1948, Freeberg provided a crucial link between the blockaded capital, Jogjakarta and sympathizers in other areas of Southeast Asia. Muharto flew with Freeberg until **May 1988**, when he was promoted and reassigned to headquarters. He had little contact with Freeberg after that, but was devastated to hear in 1 October 1948  that RI-002 had vanished while transporting a ton of Republican gold to safety in Bukittinggi. The crash site was only discovered in April 1977. An investigation revealed no clue to the fate of the gold, and a few unidentifiable human remains were gathered and buried with military honors. As the 1988 interview ends, Muharto tells Cameron that if he had declined the promotion, as he had wished to do, and stayed with RI-002, perhaps it would not have met such a tragic and mysterious fate.

[Backgrounder](synopsis/backgrounder.md) 

Two days after the 1988 interview, Cameron faxes a draft of the interview to Richard Beth, a grizzled Australian journalist based in East Asia since the Pacific War and now an editor based in Hong Kong. Richard grudgingly accepts the story for a Sunday-supplement magazine he edits, but tells Cameron confirm as many details as he can through contemporaneous news reports. 

[Cameron Meets Julia](synopsis/cameron_meets_julia.md) 

Cameron knows that the new National Library has an archives of newspapers dating back more than a century. At the library, Cameron meets Julia Suryakusuma, a bookish, attractive young woman who generally assists foreign researchers because of her fluency in English and Dutch. Cameron explains his mission, and Julia disappears into the stacks, emerging a few minutes later with  both bound newspaper collections and a few English-language books from the adjacent reference section that she thinks might be helpful. The newspaper articles corraborate most of the events Muharto described. Cameron's attention is drawn to a passage in a book by British diplomat John Coast about having a few drinks with Freeberg in **May 1948** in Bangkok. Freeberg admitted flying the Republican strategic stockpile of opium from Jogjakarta to Bukittinggi, but knows nothing about Indonesian opium now showing up in the dens of Bangkok. Coast is inclined to take Freeverg at his word, but, knowing that he is owned large sums by the Republicans and his Dakota is in bad shape, cannot help but wonder. 

[Coffee With Julia](synopsis/coffee_with_julia.md) 

After hours of research, Cameron asks where he can get a cup of coffee. Julia invites him to join her at the library canteen. Julia tells Cameron of her dream of securing a scholarship to pursue post-graduate studies in America. Cameron attempts to, in turn, tell of his dreams of becoming an international investigative journalist. But Julia stops him, saying, with a mischievious smile, that if she wants to know anything about him she will simply ask her father, a senior officer in military intelligence.   

[Richard Accepts Story](synopsis/richard_accepts_story.md) 

Richard accepts the fleshed-out draft for publication, but admonishes Cameron to now concentrate on his real work: financial reporting in the run-up to the deregulation of the Indonesian capital market at the end of the year. 

[Cameron Offers To Help](synopsis/cameron_offers_to_help.md) 

In early **October 1988**, Cameron visits Muharto to deliver a few copies of the story. Muharto is delighted, telling Cameron that  friends and colleagues had contacted him from throughout Southeast Asia in response to the article. All were eager to know what happened to Freeberg and the gold. Muharto tells Cameron that he had attemped to investigate the mystery a few years previously. Muharto describes his farcical, frustrating attempts to wrest information from the disorganized Air Force archives and government reference libraries scattered throughout the city, guarded by officious petty burearcrats. Cameron notes that with the archives now consoldiated and mananged by competent professionals, perhaps he could resume his research. Muharto suggests that they collaborate on new investigations with an eye to writing a book. Cameron agrees, and Muharto suggests they begin with a long-overdue visit to an old friend. 

# Episode 2 

Muharto takes Cameron to a long-overdue reunion with Boediardjo, the radio operator of RI-002. In his spacious salon, walls lined with an extensive collection of European art and Indonesian masters, Boediardjo, a short, heavy-set man in his early sixties, displays the Javanese statesmans ideal of blending commanding authority with refined manners and easy grace. The two old comrades revel in recounting their experiences on RI-002, with Boediardjo gently ribbing Muharto about misadventures.
