Bob does not confront his partner directly, but instead makes discreet
inquiries. He is directed to a small airfield on the outskirts of
Manila. He relocates the disputed aircraft himself, choosing another
airfield with a short runway hemmed in by houses. Only a pilot with
Bob's exceptional skill could land a large Dakota there.
