# Birth of RI-002

In June 1988, Cameron Bishop, a young American would-be journalist working as copy editor for the Jakarta Times, a start-up English-language newspaper, interviews Petit Muharto, a retired Indonesian Air Force officer. Muharto tells Cameron of his adventures flying blockade runs with American navy veteran Bob Freeberg during Indonesia's post-war fight for independence from the Dutch. Muharto ends the interview with a poignant account of his sadness when Freeberg's aircraft, RI-002, vanished while flying a cargo of Republican gold to Sumatra, and the enduring mystery of his fate. 

# White Savior

Cameron submits the article to Syd Jardine, a cynical, hard-drinking former foreign correspondent now editing the Jakarta Times. Syd remarks that Freeberg comes across as a "white savior", and suggests Cameron research his background more thoroughly in the historical archives of the newly opened national library. 

# Cute and Nerdy

In the library, Cameron is assisted by Julia Suryakusuma, a bookish, attractive woman interning at the library during her final year of college. Julia, who is fluent is English and Dutch, finds a number of books mentioning Freeberg. Cameron reads that in 1948 <incident involving Aviation Brotherhood>. Since beverages are not allowed in the reference section, Julia escorts Cameron to the library canteen and joins him for coffee. Julia tells of her desire to take post-graduate studies overseas, and casually mentions that her father is a senior officer in military intelligence. 

# Where is the Gold

The day after the interview is published, Muharto visits the Jakarta Times to thank Cameron personally and pick up more copies to give to those who also knew Freeberg. Muharto remarks that, beside praising Freeberg and his contribution to the nation, all of his friends wondered about the fate of the gold. Muharto believes that solving the mystery would be a fitting tribute to his lost friend. Cameron sees solving the mystery as his break into real journalism, and offers to help Muharto in his investigation. Syd suggests that the first step would be to learn all he can about the time and place, so Cameron returns to the library. 

# Snarky Articles

In the library, Julia is eager to assist. She takes armloads of books and newspapers from the stack, and sight-reads passages of Dutch-language text. The tone and subtext of reports in Batavia newspapers suggests that the Dutch, in particular General Simon Spoor, the commander of KNIL, the colonial military, knew more than they were letting on. Julia suggests they visit Victor deJong, a Dutch conscript soldier who elected remain and take Indonesian citizenship after independence. Victor had been a photography technician in Spoor's office, and now manages the IPPHOS historical photography collection and occasionally consults for the library. 

# Photographic Memory

The sole occupant of his ramshackle office, Victor is delighted to have visitors, and offers whatever help he can. He pulls prints and negatives from overflowing filing cabinets and shelving, seemingly at random. But each image: Freeberg resting with Boediardjo in the shade of RI-002, Spoor in his office, brings the time and place into vivid visual clarity. Victor tells of Spoor frustration, and frequent rage, at Freeberg and the other freebooting blockade runners. Julia is intrigued by one photo, a strikingly beautiful Indonesian woman in her late twenties who, though dressed in baggy, paint-splattered overalls, radiates elegance and poise. The caption reads "Emeria Soenassa in her studio, 1948". Julia asks Victor who she is. Victor replies "No one important", snatches the photo from the table and files it away.
