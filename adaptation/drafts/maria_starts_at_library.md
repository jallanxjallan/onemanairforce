Maria arrives for first day at internship in the new 25-story national library. Her task will be to assist in cataloging, and preserving many thousands of private papers, audio tapes, and films acquired donated to the library by private collectors, who see the modern, climate controlled structure as a safer alternative to their own often dilapidated homes. She will work under the supervision of Frans, a former journalist now the manager of the modern history archive. Her partner in the project is Bintang, a geeky library staff member in his mid-20s who will handle the technical process of digitizing the material.
