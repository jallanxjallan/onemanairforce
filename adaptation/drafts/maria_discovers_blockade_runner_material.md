Maria and Budi come across a collection of documents, photos, and video tapes labeled “Mystery of RI-002”. The collection is packed randomly in boxes, with minimal labeling and no index of contents. A brief cover letter to the library explains that the materials are an oral history of the revolution years, compiled during the mid 1980s when the contributions of the Indonesian Air Force and foreign pilots had been downplayed by the New Order government. Because of the controversial nature of the comments and recollections of eyewitnesses and participants, the material had never been exhibited or published. Maria notices that Bob Freeberg was referenced in the document.   Maria asks why such a comprehensive (and costly) project was hidden away. Frans replies that the material was a counter-narrative to the New Order myth that Indonesian independence was gain solely through the strategy of the army and the bravery of village youths.
