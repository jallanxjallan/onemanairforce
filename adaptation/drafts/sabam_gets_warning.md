```synopsis
Sabam is on the phone in his office. He looks striken as he replaces the handset in the cradle. He then calls to Syd and Cameron to come with him to his favorite lapo, a roadside eating and drinking stall a short walk from the Jakarta Post. Sabam orders a round of beer, and tells Syd that Deppen just called. He need say nothing more. Cameron looks confused. Syd explains that he and Sabam had been chasing a story about a top civilian government official who is forcing the air force to purchase sub-standard equipment at a huge mark-up. The Air marshalls are furious, but can do nothing, so they were hoping that Sabam can bring the story into the open. But now, the newspaper itself is in danger of being shut down. Sabam cautions his companions to be cautious about what they write, or even say, from now on, as he pointedly glances at Cameron.
