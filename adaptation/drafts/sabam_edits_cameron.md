says: "Needs more background"

glances at them, grunts, then hands them to Syd and strides out the door, followed by his driver carrying Sabam's briefcase. 

Syd reads the piece, and says it needs a photo of Freeberg himself, not just the generic photos that Muharto gave him. Syd suggests that Cameron try the Indonesian Photo Agency, IPPHOS, who have an extensive collection of images from the period. An old Dutch-born photojournalist, Victor, looks after the place. "He will find one", Syd says. "He has, literally, a 'photographic memory'".

Cameron writes up the interview, and gives it to Sabam. However, Sabam is on his way to a diplomatic dinner, and simply hands the pages to Syd, an American  retired foreign correspondent who works as senior copy editor, and rushes out the door. Syd reads the piece, and suggests that Cameron corroborate 
Muharto's story with newspaper and other reports, which he can find at the newly opened National Library. 

In the Jakarta Post newsroom, Cameron finishes the first draft of the
Muharto interview, then hands it to Syd Jardine, a disheveled,
chain-smoking, older American sitting at the adjacent desk. After
reading it, Syd tells Cameron that the article is good, but a bit thin,
and needs more context to be understandable to the Post's foreign
readership. Syd suggests Cameron go to the national library and read the
book *Recruit to Revolution*, which has a chapter on Freeberg, and all
the historical background Cameron needs.



says it is an "important piece of Indonesian history." However, he noticed that, bases on his own extensive readings of the period, Muharto has misremembered some historical events. Syd  
suggests that Cameron fact-check the piece by reading contemporaneous newspaper accounts available in the newly opened national library. Syd tells Cameron that a friend of his, Victor, a Dutch national turned Indonesian who was noted journalist in the Soekarno era, is in the archives section most most mornings. He would be happy to give Cameron a hand.
