TREATMENT


MARIA BURIES FATHER
In August 1988, Maria, a 28 year old university librarian, attends the funeral of her father, Hermann, who had had passed away from complications of alcoholism at age 65. In his eulogy, the pastor struggles to celebrate Hermann's legacy, but the attendees all know that his life had been one of tragically unfulfilled potential. In his youth, Hermann had been a skillful pilot and natural leader, on the fast track to become an Air Force general or commercial airline captain. But after his return from a tour of duty as a fighter pilot in the East Indies, Hermann had resigned his commission and abandoned aviation, settling on sporadic employment at undemanding jobs. Throughout her childhood, Hermann and Maria had been inseparable. As an adult, she had struggled to understand how her exceptionally skilled father had let his life spin out of control. A few weeks previously, Maria had jumped at an offer from her university to be seconded for a year to the newly established national library in Jakarta, where she would assist in cataloging many thousands of photographs and documents consolidated from other institutions and private collections. She hoped that spending time in Indonesia and researching the period of her father's tour of duty might help her to understand why he had abandoned such a promising career.   


MARIA MEETS VERSPOOR
At the reception following the funeral, Maria is introduced to Paul Verspoor, a fellow veteran of the East Indies conflict. Verspoor had been Hermann's squadron leader for several months, often flying with him on patrols to intercept foreign aircraft running guns to the Indonesian rebels. Verspoor had high praise for Hermann's skill and courage, though at times he could have been overly reckless. Verspoor tells of one incident when they spotted a suspected blockade runner flying above the central Sumatra plains. The target aircraft had turned and flown into a thunderstorm. Hermann wanted to follow, but Verspoor, as squadron leader, refused, knowing that single-engine fighters are more vulnerable than larger aircraft in a tropical storm. When Maria mentions that she is going to Indonesia, Verspoor suggests she look up his long-time friend Alex Kawilarang, an Indonesian national hero who played a large role in his nation's struggle for independence. 


MARIA STARTS AT LIBRARY
A few weeks later, Maria begins work at the recently opened national library in Jakarta. Her primary task is to assist in cataloging and microfilming the library's archive of periodical publications dating back to colonial times. Her colleague is Bintang, a geeky library staff member in his mid-20s who will handle the technical process of filming the material. Both work under the supervision of Frans, a former journalist with extensive experience in document and photograph archiving.




MARIA MEETS ALEX AND MUHARTO
Maria meets Alex for dinner at his favorite retro-Dutch restaurant. He is accompanied by his frequent drinks-and-dinner companion Petit Muharto, a retired Indonesian Air Force officer. Upon learning that Maria is working in the new national library, Muharto launches into wry litany of his frustrating researches for crumbling documents in dusty archives. Maria asks what he was researching. Alex indulges his old friend by encouraging him to recount his tales of youthful exploits. Muharto tells Maria of the high points of his days of blockade running, from his initial meeting with Bob Freeberg as the pilot of a charter airline, Bob's subsequent missions for the Republic in his own aircraft, designated RI-002, the deep respect Bob enjoyed from both foreigners and Indonesians, and the crucial mission he undertook flying diplomats to an international conference. Muharto ended his tales on a sad note. Some months after Muharto had been promoted to major and assigned to a desk at headquarters, RI-002 had disappeared while carrying a fortune in gold. At the time, there had been numerous unconfirmed reports that RI-002 had been intercepted and forced to land at a secret Dutch airstrip. After the discovery of the wreckage on a remote mountainside in 1977 -- with no gold and no identifiable remains -- Muharto had researched archives and spoken to the air force officers who had investigated the crash site, but had not been able to shed any light on the mystery. Maria suggests that Muharto might find the improved resources available at the library might help in his research, and invites him to visit.

MUHARTO VISITS LIBRARY
A few days later, Muharto visits the library. Maria has pulled out and displayed samples of the photographs and newspapers available in the archives. Reviewing the collection inspires Muharto to recount his adventures as co-pilot of RI-002, and of his friendship with Bob Freeberg, which he treasures to that day.  To illustrate his friend's exceptional flying ability, Muharto tells Maria of an incident when Bob flew his Dakota into a violent thunderstorm to evade a Dutch patrol. This sparks Maria's interest, leading her to think that if her father had been chasing RI-002, then this might be the way to dig up more information. Maria offers to aid Muharto in restarting his investigations. 


MARIA MEETS BOEDIARDJO
Muharto takes Maria to visit Boediardjo, the third permanent crew member of RI-002. In contrast to the romantic adventures recounted by Muharto, Boedi tells amusing tales of the RI-002 blockade runs, such as when they lived in penury in Manila while trying to sell the quinine, the time he and Muharto had to find accommodation in the nightlife district of Bangkok.




BOEDI TELLS DIFFERENT STORY
But when she needs to check some info and returns alone, he tells very different stories, especially that Bob and Muharto were never really friends. Bob had no stake in the struggle except for a possibility of cashing in by starting a new airline in an independent Indonesia. B


Boedi tells of his friendship with the Aviation Brotherhood, and suspected intelligence asset Tom Lee. 
 
Boedi gets info on diplomatic machinations from Tom Lee. Close relationship of the type boedi will cultivate on his rise to the top.In Manila in January 1948, Boedi speaks with Tom Lee, who tells him that both the Dutch and the Americans are out to get Freeberg. 


MARIA IN JOGJA


SPOOR GOES BALLISTIC
Julius Tahija tells Maria that the Dutch were furious that Freeberg had fooled them in Singapore. But a few days later it was reported that the operation had actually been a gun-running operation gone wrong. This sent Spoor into paroxysms of fury, according to Tahija, who then vowed to crack down on blockade runs, and bring down RI-002 especially.

BINTANG SUSPECTS KOPASSUS
As he digs through the material and discovers the results of investigations undertaken three decades before, Bintang becomes convinced that RI-002 had crashed with the gold, and the remote crash site looted years later by an elite military unit. 







MARIA SMELLS A COUP
Maria, on the other hand, accepts Muharto's conclusion that Spoor intercepted RI-002 to steal the gold to fund a coup.

DINNER WITH VERSPOOR
Verspoor, who was visiting Jakarta, told Maria over dinner with Alex that this indeed had been the turning point. They now received special instructions. She pressed Verspoor for more info on her father, but to now avail. When he had excused himself, Alex winked at her and said: That's Paul. He knows far more than he will ever tell.

Freeberg had impressed Muharto by readily agreeing to perform the risky maneuver of landing on a disused runway during the return leg to determine whether it could be used as an air base. Thanks to Freeberg's exceptional flying skills, the the landing and takeoff had been effortless.

NOTES


REASON FOR HIJACKING
Bintang believes it is Kopassus
Maria belives it is a coup by Spoor
Julius and Hans insist that Spoor would not mount coup.
In fact it was pure corruption.

FIRST CALI RUNS
Muharto, a dapper man in his sixties sitting in a middle-class suburban home, tells of his role in organizing the initial blockade runs from Singapore to Jogjakarta with CALI, a Manila-based air transport company. Bob Freeberg had been the pilot of the third CALI flight. Freeberg had impressed Muharto by readily agreeing to perform the risky maneuver of landing on a disused runway during the return leg to determine whether it could be used as an air base. Thanks to Freeberg's exceptional flying skills, the  landing and takeoff had been effortless. 


BIRTH OF RI-002
Muharto tells of his second meeting three months later, when Freeberg made an emergency landing of his own aircraft on a remote beach and told the astounded local fishermen to contact Muharto in Jogjakarta. Muharto flew to the nearby army base and was driven to the beach, where he discovered that Freeberg had been attempting to fly to Jogja but had become lost due to inadequate charts. Muharto convinced the villagers to help Freeberg escape before being spotted by a Dutch patrol by fashioning a makesp 

A Dutch fighter had been spotted circling Tasik as Muharto arrived. The fighter had turned back north, but the chances were that a subsequent patrol might continue to the coast. They had to get the Dakota off the beach. 

BOEDIARDJO
Maria meets Boedi tells Maria of Freeberg back story as told to him by Aviation Brotherhood. He tells amusing stories of Muharto's incompetence and gentle ribbing by Freeberg in RI-002.  Boedi gives alternate version of Freeberg and Muharto friendship.

HADI SANTOSO
Maria and Bintang meet children of RI-002 crash victims. Fuad Bakri tells how angry he was at the condescending attitude of Sulaiman in telling them to forget about the missing gold. Hadi Santoso reveals that he had surreptitiously pocketed a necklace he knew to be his fathers when viewing the remains before the funeral. Muharto had gone into trance and relived the crash from the point of view of the co-pilot when he had touched the necklace during their meeting.

Hadi Santoso visits the air force base in Palembang and talk to former workers at Karangendah. 
Santoso's son tells of the coffins, the dogtags, Sulaiman's misleading briefing, and his mother's paranormal experience.

Muharto himself fills in some gaps. Like many Javanese gentleman he cultivate s psychic powers. When touching objects recovered from the wrecked plane he sees Freeberg was not on it. In his vision, he sees Bambang at the controls.

Maria encounters obstacles at every turn.   


As the research brings the subject into focus, Maria realizes that the failure to find gold at the crash site suggests three equally disturbing possibilities. If the gold had been on RI-002 when it went down, only a disciplined military unit could have accessed the site and transported and disposed of the gold undetected. If the gold had not been on the plane,  
RI-002 might have landed on a Dutch airstrip, either intentionally or under threat from Dutch fighters. 
Freeberg and accomplices might have landed in a remote area, removed the cargo






Bintang, Maria's fellow intern, becomes convinced 


Maria fears that her father had participated in a clandestine mission to intercept the aircraft and steal the cargo to fund a coup attempt with the tacit approval of the Americans. When she voices her view to others, and 












increasing disallusionment 
 describes the growing disillusionment of Freeberg at the demanding missions and difficulty dealing with Suryadarma. He was also getting annoyed at Bambang, now his permanent co-pilot, who had an inflated opinion of his aviation abilities. 


Boedi demolishes Muharto's view of Freeberg as an authentic, if reserved, heroic figure. He was only in if to make a living, though unquestionably he was a decent and fair man.






Maria is threatened with deportation. Frans explains that with the New Order government trying to attract foreign investment, the last thing they need is to embarrass the Dutch government with evidence of a military coup.


Hans reveals that Spoor was chasing arms sales to the Republic. The plot was hatched to capture the RI-002 gold, buy arms and sell them to the Republic. They were in league with the communist officers in AURI, who provided the information on when and where to intercept RI-002. 


In his trance, Muharto saw that Bob was not the pilot. It then seemed logical that he was detained and later died, proving that he did not take the gold. 


Hermann was blinded by his obsession to bring down Freeberg. But found out he only bested Bambang.
Hermann thought he was involved in funding a coup, but actually participated in corruption. After Spoor was poisoned, Hans speculates, Freeberg was killed and Hermann threatened with exposure. Maria believes that his obsession with Freeberg led him to errors in judgment, and decided to never fly again. 


LIBRARY TASKS
Throughout her childhood, Hermann and Maria had been inseparable. As an adult, she had struggled to understand how her exceptionally skilled father had let his life spin out of control. A few weeks previously, Maria had jumped at an offer from her university to be seconded for a year to the newly established national library in Jakarta, where she would assist in cataloging many thousands of photographs and documents consolidated from other institutions and private collections. She hoped that spending time in Indonesia and researching the period of her father's tour of duty might help her to understand why he had, essentially, wasted his life.
