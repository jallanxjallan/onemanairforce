IDEAS


MARIA DOUBTS MOTIVES OF ALEX AND VERSPOOR
Frans suggests that Alex and Verspoor are using her embarrass military for revenge by discovering that they took the RI-002 gold in 1978. Alex is out of favorite, and Verspoor mysteriously took early retirement. If she finds something embarrassing, she will be deported, but they would be ok. 
Alex and Verspoor using Maria her embarrass military for revenge by discovering that they took the RI-002 gold in 1978.
Maria begins to wonder about them. Does research. Finds out that Alex was in jail, started Kopassus, but was shut out of New Order business. Verspoor unexpectedly turned down promotion to staff position though a seeming shoe in.

Maria confides to Frans, the archivist who is mentoring her at the library. His theory is that they wanted Maria to find out more about Freeberg's disappearance and what happened to the gold. If someone, like a military squadron leader, had taken it, and was now in government, they would use that knowledge to blackmail or cause other mischief.


KOPASSUS DID IT
Bintang suggests that only Kopassus could have found the gold and spirited it away without detection. His uncle had been kidnapped and killed by Kopassus. If he could prove that the elite corps had desecrated a crash site and left the remains of national heroes, he would have his revenge. He talks Maria into researching the history of RI-002 to try to determine if the gold was still in the aircraft when it crashed.

RAYMOND WESTERLING


HERMANN
Maria's grandfather
Born in 1922
26 years old in 1948
94 when he died in 2016
Top notch air ace in KNIL

Was impressed by Freebergs skill when one of Indonesia civilian admin workers (Dutch Educated) told him of Freeberg landing big C-47 on Karangendah short field.

Made it his mission to intercept RI-002 and prove his superiority.

Was assigned to force down RI-002 over remote mountains without shooting it down. 

Back at base he destroyed flight records for the week. fuel consumption etc records for first week Oct 1948 to create confusion and cover up evidence of unauthorized interception. 

Did so, but was appalled to discover that Freeberg had not been the pilot. Then discovered that RI-002 had not been taken as part of a coup, but as simple corruption by KNIL officers. 

Leaves ML, and does not seek work in private aviation. Afraid that past might be through a chance meeting with a fellow pilot or a background check. 


Spoor under pressure to find out what happened to RI-002. Has suspicions that something is going on.


Muharto remembers that flight logs were mysteriously missing.  Verspoor confesses that he knew. He kept all the secrets, including that Westerling had phoned him and asked is he would support a coup. He was protecting his men, and their reputations, even if their actions were wrong. 

After RI-002 disappeared, Verspoor asked for Herman back, as his new guy was a disaster. But was told that Herman had requested, and was granted, a transfer back to infantry. 



Herman asked to destroy all flight, f

Herman learns of death of Lt Arnault. Fears that he might be next if he speaks.

In mess hall Hans talks to him and stores clerk, and hints that he might be open to some off-site sales. This spooks Herman as well. 

Hermann wants to prove himself by beating Freeberg.
Just like bambang needs to prove himself by flying freebergs plane.




PAUL VERSPOOR


Verspoor flew interception of Dave Fowler flight. 

Verspoor knew of clandestine flight while he was away.
knew Herman had destroyed the logs of an illegal operation. Said he would not tell anyone if he left the service. 


During meetings drip feeds Maria on Herman's story, then asks about results of her investigations. 
Verspoor reveals that he had served in the same fighter squadron as Hermann. However, he is vague about his experiences with Hermann, revealing only that Maria's father had been obsessed with the prospect of intercepting and capturing the “notorious” Bob Freeberg, an American pilot who flew a cargo aircraft with Indonesian markings between the Republican bases of Jogjakarta and Bukittinggi and regional centers such as Manila and Bangkok. Alex suggests that Maria learn more about the period by meeting his long-time friend Petit Muharto, an Indonesian Air Force captain who had been Freeberg's co-pilot.

NOTES


LIBRARY
Have fun with 80s video technology

GOLD
• two 20 kg empty cases found at crash site
• if found by villagers, would have rigged up harness to carry cases by two people on shoulders. The usual way of moving heavy, awkward objects in villages.
• if found by army, would have emptied the cases and hauled gold out in backpacks of soldiers.
• if Dutch, would have needed to get rid of cases so gold could not be linked back to RI. Best way would be to leave them on the plane.
