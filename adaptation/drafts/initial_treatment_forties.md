At Maguwo Air Force base in Jogjakarta, Captain Petit Muharto receives a telephone call from an army base in western Java, informing him that the American pilot of an airplane that had made an emergency landing on a nearby beach had asked for him by name.   

On the ground, Bambang continually jockeys for a mission with RI-002 so he can gain his Dakota rating. 

Muharto fights with Suryadarma. 

On each trip to Manila, Bob faces yet another challenge from Bob Walters. 

In Bukittinggi, Richard Cobley calls out Bob. Boedi stands and defends him. 

During the Soekarno tour, Bambang repeatedly tries to ingratiate himself with the president, to Boedi's endless amusement. 

In Batavia, Spoor is battling his government's policy of granting independence with his own conviction that the archipelago cannot be governed by Indonesians. Some factions push for a coup. An unpleasant man with dictatorial tendencies, Spoor is friendless. 

But fair. Hermann flies a mission intercepting the POAS flight. Under new rules of engagement, he is permitted to fire. He reports first. Spoor gets on the line and tells the pilots to disengage as reports say civilians are on board.

The physical and financial stresses of blockade running transform Bob Freeberg from a passionate, optimistic adventurer to a haggard, disillusioned cynic.  



The collection also includes documents pertaining to the unsuccessful efforts of Petit Muharto to solve the mystery of the disappearance of RI-002. In a quixotic quest to honor the memory of his friend and comrade, Muharto researched archives and interviewed dozens of witnesses, including the families of the RI-002 members who perished on the final flight. But Muharto was stymied at every turn by a paucity of verifiable sources and the outright reluctance of Air Force officials to discuss the case. 



As he digs through the material and discovers the results of investigations undertaken three decades before, Bintang becomes convinced that RI-002 had crashed with the gold, and the remote crash site looted years later by an elite military unit. Maria argues that ``
Maria, on the other hand, accepts Muharto's conclusion that Spoor intercepted RI-002 to steal the gold to fund a coup.

Both of these interpretations are problematical. During that year the governments of the Netherlands and Indonesia were engaged in sensitive negotiations for atrocities committed on both sides. The Dutch did not want revelations of a rogue military, and the Indonesians don't want stories about the military desecrating a grave of   

It was plain old corruption. Everyone involved was paid to keep their mouths shut. Hermann went along because he wanted to be the one to take down Bob Freeberg.
