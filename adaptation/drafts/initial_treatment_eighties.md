#Maria buries grandfather
In August 1988, Maria, who has just graduated from university in the Netherlands, attends the funeral of Hermann, her beloved grandfather, who had had passed away from complications of alcoholism at age 65. The reverend struggles to portray Hermann in the best light, but the attendees all know that his life had be one of tragically unfulfilled potential. In his youth, Hermann had been a skillful and passionate pilot, but had resigned his commission and abandoned aviation after his return from a tour of duty as a fighter pilot in the East Indies. 

At the reception following the funeral, Maria is introduced to Paul Verspoor, a fellow veteran of the East Indies conflict. Verspoor had been Hermann's squadron leader for several months, often flying with him on patrols to intercept foreign aircraft running guns to the Indonesian rebels. Verspoor had high praise for Hermann's skill and courage, though at times he could have been overly reckless. 

Verspoor tells of one incident when they spotted a suspected blockade runner flying above the central Sumatra plains. The target aircraft had turned and flown into a thunderstorm. Hermann wanted to follow, but Verspoor, as squadron leader, refused, knowing that single-engine fighters are more vulnerable than larger aircraft in a tropical storm. 

Maria tells Verspoor that she is traveling to Indonesia for a post-graduate internship in the national library. Verspoor suggests she look up his long-time friend Alex Kawilarang, an Indonesian national hero who played a large role in his nation's struggle for independence. 

A few weeks later, Maria begins her internship at the recently opened national library in Jakarta. Her primary task is to assist in cataloging and microfilming the library's archive of periodical publications dating back to colonial times. Her colleague is Bintang, a geeky library staff member in his mid-20s who will handle the technical process of filming the material. Both work under the supervision of Frans, a former journalist with extensive experience in document and photograph archiving.

Maria soon meets Alex for dinner at his favorite retro-Dutch restaurant. He is accompanied by his frequent drinks-and-dinner companion Petit Muharto, a retired Indonesian Air Force officer. Upon learning that Maria is working in the new national library, Muharto launches into wry litany of his frustrating researches into the mysterious disappearance of RI-002, the blockade runner piloted by American Bob Freeberg that disappeared with a fortune in gold during the struggle for independence. Maria suggests that Muharto might find the improved resources available at the library might help in his research, and invites him to visit.

A few days later, Muharto visits the library. Maria has pulled out and displayed samples of the photographs and newspapers available in the archives. Reviewing the collection inspires Muharto to recount his adventures as co-pilot of RI-002, and of his friendship with Bob Freeberg, which he treasures to that day. 

To illustrate his friend's exceptional flying ability, Muharto tells Maria of an incident when Bob flew his Dakota into a violent thunderstorm to evade a Dutch patrol. This sparks Maria's interest, leading her to think that if her grandfather had been chasing RI-002, then this might be the way to dig up more information. Maria offers to aid Muharto in restarting his investigations. 

They begin by visiting Boediarjo, the third permanent crew member of RI-002. 


But when she needs to check some info and returns alone, he tells very different stories, especially that Bob and Muharto were never really friends. Bob had no stake in the struggle except for a possibility of cashing in by starting a new airline in an independent Indonesia. B

Boedi tells of his friendship with the Aviation Brotherhood, and suspected intelligence asset Tom Lee. 
 

During the following weeks, the taped recollections of the interviewees and accompanying photographs and documents will evoke for Maria vivid images of daring exploits in the sky, and stoic endurance of privation on the ground. Bob Freeberg and RI-002 feature prominently in the collections. Maria will learn the story of Bob Freeberg and RI-002. Two retired Indonesian Air Force officers, Petit Muharto and Boediardjo, who served on RI-002, will tell of the essential contribution of Freeberg to the Republic. The recollections of Julius Tahija, adjutant to Dutch military commander Simon Spoor, will illustrate the colonial government's efforts to stop the blockade runs by any means. Through this vivid evocations of the experiences, Maria will see the physical and financial stresses of blockade running transform Bob Freeberg from a passionate, optimistic adventurer to a haggard, disillusioned cynic who disappeared, along with his aircraft, crew, and a fortune in gold, after 16 months of flying in support of the struggle for independence.

The collection also includes documents pertaining to the unsuccessful efforts of Petit Muharto to solve the mystery of the disappearance of RI-002. In a quixotic quest to honor the memory of his friend and comrade, Muharto researched archives and interviewed dozens of witnesses, including the families of the RI-002 members who perished on the final flight. But Muharto was stymied at every turn by a paucity of verifiable sources and the outright reluctance of Air Force officials to discuss the case. 

Boedi gets info on diplomatic machinations from Tom Lee. Close relationship of the type boedi will cultivate on his rise to the top.In Manila in January 1948, Boedi speaks with Tom Lee, who tells him that both the Dutch and the Americans are out to get Freeberg. 


Dutch were furious that Freeberg had fooled them in Singapore. But a few days later it was reported that the operation had actually been a gun-running operation gone wrong. This sent Spoor into paroxysms of fury, according to Tahija, who then vowed to crack down on blockade runs, and bring down RI-002 especially.

Verspoor, who was visiting Jakarta, told Maria over dinner with Alex that this indeed had been the turning point. They now received special instructions. She pressed Verspoor for more info on her grandfather, but to now avail. When he had excused himself, Alex winked at her and said: That's Paul. He knows far more than he will ever tell. 


As he digs through the material and discovers the results of investigations undertaken three decades before, Bintang becomes convinced that RI-002 had crashed with the gold, and the remote crash site looted years later by an elite military unit. 
Maria, on the other hand, accepts Muharto's conclusion that Spoor intercepted RI-002 to steal the gold to fund a coup.


It was plain old corruption. Everyone involved was paid to keep their mouths shut. Hermann went along because he wanted to be the one to take down Bob Freeberg.

Lat scene: Muharto takes necklace from Hadi Santoso and goes into trance.

Back in the Netherlands, Maria meets Verspoor again. He finally acknowledges that he knew about the planned coup, but did not speak to save the reputation of the crew and families.
