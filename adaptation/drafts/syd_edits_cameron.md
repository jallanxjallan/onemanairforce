Cameron sits at his desk, making final corrections on a paper copy of his article. Sabam emerges from his office, waving a copy of the Jakarta Post
newspaper, ands strides into the newsroom. Cameron stands up to give the article draft to Sabam, but the editor ignores him and goes to the adjacent desk of  Syd Jardine, a disheveled,
chain-smoking, older American. Sabam slams the newspaper on his desk,
points to an article entitled "Ladyboy Molested By Sex-Crazed Gang",
with the byline: "Our Reporter" and shouts: "This is a family
newspaper!".

As Sabam turns, Cameron gives Sabam the sheets of paper. He scans the first page, grunts, gives the sheets to Syd  carries them back to his office. As Syd reads the draft, Cameron reaches over from his adjacent desk, takes the paper, chuckles,
and says "This is your best yet. Where did you get it?" Syd replies: "A
becak driver showed it to me as he drove me back from the bar. We had a good laugh about it. If you
really want to understand a people, read the tabloids."

A moment later, Sabam calls Cameron into his office. He tells Cameron that the piece needs more background, suggesting he go to the library and read a book he had recently discovered in the reference section: *Recruit to Revolution*
