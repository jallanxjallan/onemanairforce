Victor marches off a troop ship with other conscripts. While waiting for transport to the barracks, Victor photographs a paper boy, then buys a newspaper from him seconds before the police chase the boy away. The other soldiers gather around Victor as he reads aloud in Dutch what is obviously Indonesian-language text, occasionally pausing to look up a word in a Dutch-Malay pocket dictionary.
