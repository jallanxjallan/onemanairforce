# Meeting Muharto
Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when they hear the roar of a large motorcycle approaching. Muharto, in jest, covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani opens it to find Cameron, in jeans and motorcycle boots, asking for Muharto. 

Once over his surprise at being interviewed by a "Hell's Angel" Muharto tells the story of the Bob Freeberg and RI-002, beginning with a surprise call he received a his desk in Maguwo Air Base in Jogjakarta. 

# Flight to Tasik

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit
monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even
seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight,
Muharto pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it must be
Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before when he
accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the
Manilia-based CALI charter airline.

# Muharto Investigates
Muharto tells Cameron that the situation was so chaotic, with the Dutch threatening to invade the Republic, that a proper search of the rugged terrain on the flight path was not possible. A few years previously Muharto had began his own investigations in AURI archives, finding the report of the team sent to investigate the crash site.

in the Air Force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site
investigation, but received vague, non-committal replies --- or only
silence. 


# Muharto Regrets
Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob's
remains, could not be buried with the others because he was a foreigner.
Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash
site, wholly accident, some five years previously. He wrote his contacts
in the air force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site
investigation, but received only vague, non-committal replies -- or only
silence. Muharto's expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying,
wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of
RI-002 than they are telling.
Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob’s
remains, could not be buried with the others as a foreigner cannot be interred in a cemetery for national heroes, however much he may deserve the honor himself through his services to the nation.

Muharto’s expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto wonders that if he had turned down promotion and had been with Bob on the final flight, maybe it would not have ended in tragedy. 

Muharto ends his recollection by explaining how Freeberg vanished  while transporting a fortune in gold to safety ahead of an expected Dutch invasion. Farmers had stumbled upon the wreckage of RI-002 on a remote mountainside ten years previously, but could not identify Freeberg's remains from the few fragments of bones they found. Cameron senses the genuine sadness in Muharto that the fate of his friend and fellow pilot remains unknown.
