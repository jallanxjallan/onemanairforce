Hi Orlow

For years everyone has been saying I should stop writing about other people and write my own story. Maybe now is the time to do it, at least a highly fictionalized version, in service of the One Man Air Force screenplay.

As in Land and Freedom, the historical segments would be based on the recollections of witnesses to the events, in this case recorded interviews during the late 1980s with several prominent Indonesians who, has young men, had been rank-and-file freedom fighters. But in this case, the wrapper itself, not only the historical events, can provide much of the conflict and resolution needed for dramatic impact. 

The genesis of Petit Muharto's investigations of RI-002, and ultimately One Man Air Force, was me being assigned to interview him in order to provide historical context to an advertising supplement on Indonesian aviation I was preparing for The Jakarta Post. 

At the time The Jakarta Post, which had been established as a few years previously, was under great pressure from shareholders to prove that and English-language newspaper would be financially viable. I proposed to help the paper out by generating supplements, both producing the copy and selling the ads. During the late 80s and early 90s I was quite successful, contributing a not-insignificant amount to the newspaper's bottom line. 

However, this bought me into conflict with other figures in the newsroom. Sabam Siagian, a Ben Bradlee figure, recognized my value but was concerned that on one day of every month a full eight pages of his paper with be filled with advertorial copy instead of real news. And I was deeply envied by the other staff members when they knew how much money I was making. 

In the larger picture, Sabam himself was under pressure to maintain journalistic standards during the repressive New Order regime. He knew that as an English-language publication he would get away with publishing opinions that would have summarily shut the doors of an Indonesian-language newspaper. But there were limits that Sabam continually bumped up against. 

So. I suggest we use the dramatic struggles of the early Jakarta Post years to mirror the primary theme of the book: the betrayal of the passionate youthful idealism of the revolution with the mercenary environment and political repression of the late New Order period. 

The basic story would be that the bule journalist/pr hack would interview Muharto, learn the story, and realize that the old man was saddened by the abandonment of revolutionary ideals and possibility that he has been personally betrayed by his supposed friend Bob Freeberg, who might have stolen the gold for himself, perhaps in cahoots with the despicable Dutch.

So the journalist manque, seeing his big chance, investigates by using his Jakarta Post credentials to gain access to witnesses now in powerful positions. At first it goes well, with the old men eager to recount tales of youthful adventure. But as the researcher uncovers sensitive info and follows up with difficult questions, the interviewees complain to Sabam. He tries to talk the researcher into keeping the interviews only about business, for his own protection, but is overridden by the advertising department, as the supplements have opened flood gates of advertising revenue as the economy booms. 

It all comes to a head when Sabam receives a call from the dreaded Minister of Information. An hour later he tells the researcher to pack his bags. The following day, on his way to the airport, he drops by Muharto's house to say goodbye and drop off his research materials for safe keeping. He shows Muharto a photo of RI-002 on a Dutch airfield, and the statement from an airfield gardener that he had seen Freeberg being taken away in chains. Muharto now knows that Freeberg had not betrayed his friendship, and the researcher leaves Indonesia with some sense of satisfaction. 

What do you think? I will need a significant amount of time to develop a treatment detailed enough to show how the various story arcs of the revolutionary years are mirrored in the Indonesia of the late 80s and the drama of the Jakarta Post news- and board-rooms, so I will need to know your thoughts on whether this will work before I start. 

BTW, Layla and I have decided to take the day train on Monday 22 June. We will arrive at Jatinegara at 5 and will stay in Tebet. Want to meet for a beer Monday Happy Hour instead of lunch on Tuesday? Or do both? 

cheers
