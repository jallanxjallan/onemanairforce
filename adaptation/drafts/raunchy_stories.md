 Boedi emphasizes that Soekarno always respected Bob, and in  later years, Soekarno openly praised Freeberg, calling him a "Dear Boy"/

The guests leave to catch an early flight. Boedi invites Cameron to stay on and listen to life with the Aviation Brotherhood, and indicates that Freeberg might not have been the saint depicted by Muharto. He tells Cameron that the Quinine Case was not the only time they visited the Manila courtroom.
