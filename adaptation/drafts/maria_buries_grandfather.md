On 1 June 2018 in the Netherlands, Maria, a recent college graduate, attends her the funeral of her grandfather, Hermann. The reverend tells of a man who had been a highly skilled pilot for the Dutch colonial forces in Indonesia after the Pacific War, but on his return had inexplicably abandoned what would have been a promising career in civilian aviation. Though he had lived a productive life well into his 90s, he had a sense of melancholy about him. Maria announces that she has received a grant to work for a year in the national library of Indonesia.
