**Landing At Cilotok - 08 June 1947**:  Bob Freeberg lands  his unmarked Dakota cargo plane on remote Cilotok beach in southwest  Java. As soldiers approach the airplane, guns ready, he shouts out the  only Indonesian words he knows, "Captain Petit Muharto".

**Birth of RI-002 - 28 June 1988**:  American freelance journalist Cameron Bishop interviews retired Air Force Major Petit  Muharto at his home in Jakarta about his experiences with Bob Freeberg. Muharto begins with the surprising message he received at Maguwo air base reporting that a foreign pilot was asking for him. Muharto flies to the location, discovering that Freeberg is the pilot of a blockade run he had organzied some weeks before. Muharto draws on the revolutionary furor of the locals to construct a bamboo runway and the Dakota takes off and flies to Jogja. 

In Jogja, Muharto's commander, Suryadarma, contracts Freeberg to fly a load of high-value quinine and vanilla to Manila, returning with much-needed vehicle parts and medicines. As the war-surplus Dakota has not yet been registered, Muharto suggests they paint the numbers RI-002 on the tail to forestall problems with aviation authorities. 

Freeberg flies RI-002 to Manila with Muharto, Army Lieutenant Pang Soeparto, and Budiardjo, a radio operator. Freeberg and his "Javanese Crew" become media celebrities, but are stranded in Manila for months, fighting Dutch representations for the right to sell the cargo. Freeberg is also in court, attempting to reach an agreement with Bob Walters, his former partner, over ownership of RI-002. 

Muharto and Pang finally win their case, sell the quinine, and RI-002 returns to Jogja. For the next six months, Freeberg, often with Muharto in the co-pilot seat, links the besieged Republic of Indonesia with the rest of the world. Freeberg is hailed as a hero, gaining the respect of everyone from common citizens to President Soekarno himself. 

By April 1948, Freeberg's haggard appearance and premature greying reflects the constant strain of being the Republic's "One Man Air Force". In May 1948 offered a promotion to major and reassignment to a desk job. Worried about his friend, Muharto considers declining the promotion. However, he is now engaged to his girlfiend Ani, and must think about their future. 

Busy with his own duties, Muharto sees little of Freeberg, but is nonetheless dismayed when informed of the disappearance of RI-002 when flying a load of Republican gold to Sumatra in October 1948. 

Muharto ends the September 1988 interview by telling Cameron that the wreckage of RI-002 was discovered a decade previously on a remote mountain in Sumatra. No gold was found, and the few skeletal fragments of body parts unidentifiable. Muharto wonders if he had elected to continue flying with Freeberg, the tragedy might have been averted.    

Cameron submits the article to Syd Jardine, a retired foreign correpondent now copy editor of the Jakarta Times, the English-language newspaper that commissied the piece. Syd remarks that Freeberg comes across as a "white savior", and suggests Cameron do his own research to flesh out his  character and motives.

The following day, Cameron uses his "foreign correspondent" credentials to gain access to the reference section of the National Library. Julia Suryakusuma, an attractive, bookish woman in her early 20s, the only staffer speaking fluent English, is assigned to assist him. Cameron explains his mission, and Julia disappears into the stacks, returning shortly with some books written by foreigners about the period. One author's account of an incident in January 1948 in a Singapore bar shows how most aviators considered Freeberg the most skilled and courageous of their brotherhood, but were envious of his exclusive contract with the Republic. 

After completing his research, Cameron has coffee with Julia, who tells of her dream of taking her post-graduate studies in America, then casually mentions that her father is a military intelligence officer.
