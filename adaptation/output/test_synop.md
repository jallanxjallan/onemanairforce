**07 June 1947Y at on Cilotok Beach **Bob Freeberg lands his unmarked
Dakota cargo plane on a remote beach in southwest Java, the huge
aircraft shuddering to a stop a few meters from a cliff at one end.
Villagers appear, marveling at this colossus from the sky. They are
friendly and offer Bob and his two Filipino crew members food and a
place to sleep. But the following morning, Indonesian soldiers appear.
One points to the lack of registration on the Dakotas tail and shouts
"*Mata-Mata*!", "Spy!" They point their rifles directly at Bob. He
replies with the only words they might understand, a name: "Captain
Petit Muharto"

**25 September 1988Y at in the Muharto residence **Cameron Bishop, an
American journalism student interning at the Jakarta Post, calls on
retired Air Force Major Petit Muharto to interview him about his
experiences flying blockade runs with Bob Freeberg in his war-surplus
Dakota registered to the new Republic of Indonesia as RI-002. Muharto
begins with the surprising message he received at his desk at Maguwo air
base in Jogjakarta.

**Flashing back to 08 June 1947Y at at Maguwo airfield **Muharto
receives a message flown by airborne military courier from Pang
Soeparto, an army lieutenant stationed in Tasikmalaya. The message
contains the news that a foreign pilot had landed an unmarked cargo
aircraft on a nearby beach and, astoundingly, had asked for Muharto by
name. Muharto takes this information to his commander, Suryadarma, who
agrees that the matter is worth investigation.

**25 September 1988Y at in the Muharto residence **Muharto flies to
Tasikmalaya in an open-cockpit Japanese monoplane. During the flight, he
wonders which of the blockade-running pilots he might be, The first two
had been routine commercial runs, with even a flight attendent. His
thoughts drift to the last, and most eventful blockade run two months
before.

**Later that day at  **This aircraft, a Nikosoren, was one of a score
barely servicable planes the Japanese had left behind. The air force
mechanics kept these aircraft flying through skill and guesswork, but
Muharto was aware that any flight could end in disaster. To keep his
mind from this eventuality, Muharto thought about the American pilots he
had met during the blockade runs he had organized from Singapore to
Jogjakarta. He decided that only Bob Freeberg possessed the skill and
nerve to land at night on a remote beach. Bob had been the pilot of the
third blockade run. Though these had been standard charter flights --
they even had a flight attendant, a lovely Filipina named Miss Brown --
the third flight would test the skills of any aviator.

**Flashing back to 31 March 1947Y at aboard the CALI Dakota **Muharto
leads a blockade run with Bob Freeberg, then a contract pilot for a
Manila-based charter airline, as captain. Amid poor visibility over
Java, Bob demonstrates his piloting skill by diving through a break in
the clouds, leveling off under the cloud cover a few hundred meters
above the ground. Muharto spots a railway line, and tells Bob that it
leads along the valley to terminate in Jogja. Bob follows the line,
barely visible through the rain, while Muharto desperately tries to
remember if there is a tunnel between their current location and
Jogjakarta.

**Later that day at at Maguwo airfield **Suryadarma tells Muharto that
this will be his last blockade run. An Indian businessman has offered to
link India with the Republic with his own Dakota, registered as VT-CLA.
He has the full support of the Indian government, so further chartered
runs will not be necessary. Muharto is disappointed, but this will be
memorable, as Suryadarma asks Bob to make a couple of detours on the way
back to Singapore. Bob cheerfully agrees.

**25 September 1988Y at in the Muharto residence **Muharto tells Cameron
that he was pleased at this display of crucial international support,
but dismayed that once again he will be desk-bound. However, this last
fight would prove to be memorable. Suryadarma had asked Bob to make a
couple of detours on the way back to Singapore, risky activities more
suited to a military mission that a civilian charter flight.
Nonetheless, Bob had cheerfully agreed.

**Flashing back to 31 March 1947Y at at Karangendah airfield **Engines
roaring with reversed props, Bob makes a spectacular landing on a
refurbished Japanese airstrip at Karangendah on the grasslands of south
Sumatra. Santoso, the base commander climbs aboard to meet them. After a
short conversation, Santoso exits, and Bob takes off, the wheels finally
lifting off the runway a few meters before the end.

**08 June 1947Y at on Cilotok Beach **Muharto and Pang marvel that the
pilot had been able to land on this short stretch of beach, bookended by
high bluffs. Muharto recognizes Freeberg and they greet as friends.
Fearing that a patrolling Dutch fighter could appear at any time,
Muharto, in a stirring speech, implores the assembled villagers to tear
apart their houses to fashion an improvised runway from the bamboo mats
used as walls. They do so, and with Muharto and Pang on board, the
Dakota takes off and flies to Maguwo.

**Later that day at at Maguwo airfield **Suryadarma commissions Bob to
fly a cargo of high-value quinine to Manila and return with essential
medicines and spare parts. Muharto expresses concern about the reception
that might await unmarked aircraft carrying high-value goods into
Manila. He suggests that they paint a fictitious registration number
onto the tail. After some debate, Muharto, Bob, and Suryadarma agree on
"RI-002", reserving "RI-001" for a future presidential aircraft.

**25 September 1988Y at in the Muharto residence **Muharto explains the
mundane but essential mission, and the dangers of evading Dutch patrols.
Muharto tells Cameron that the people of Jogja came to regard the modest
and unassuming American as some sort of superhero, an incarnation of a
mythic figure from the wayang shadow-play theater. This often led to
embarrassing situations, such as when Bob invited Muharto to dine with
him at the Hotel Merdeka, where he stayed while in Jogja.

**Flashing back to 01 October 1947Y at Presidential Palace **During a
tour of the palace with Muharto Bob is astounded to be ushered into the
office of President Soekarno. As was his custom in private conversation,
Soekarno treats Bob as an equal and puts him at ease, imploring the
American to do what he can to help the Indonesian struggle for freedom.

**15 November 1947Y at Hotel Merdeka **Bob and Muharto have dinner.
Muharto is served rice and tempe. Bob, to his great embarrassment, is
given slices of freshly friend corned beef.

**30 November 1947Y at at Maguwo airfield **Bob's greatest service to
the Republic was flying top officials and technocrats to a United
Nation's conference in the Philippines, where they successfully made the
case for Indonesian independence. These educated men treat Bob with the
same great respect as do the common people of Jogja.

**25 September 1988Y at in the Muharto residence **Muharto tells Cameron
that he flew with RI-002 until May 1948, when he was promoted to major
and posted to headquarters. Muharto saw little of Bob after that, but
was looking for forward to having Bob as guest of honor at this wedding
in October.

**Flashing back to 30 September 1948Y at at Maguwo airfield **Muharto
sees Bob off on the runway. Bob tells Muharto that he will be in
Singapore and Manila for a couple of weeks, but promises to return to
Jogja with his own fiancee in time to attend Muharto's wedding.

**25 September 1988Y at in the Muharto residence **Muharto tells Cameron
that on the afternoon of 1 October he heard reports that RI-002 had not
arrived at Bukittinggi. In the following days, the Dutch denied any
knowledge of the disappearance, and the Republic was unable to mount
more than a cursory search. Muharto shows Cameron a clipping dated 1983
about ratten gatherers finding wreckage on a remote mountain in South
Sumatra. Muharto said that he used his AURI credentials to research the
archives for the investigation report. He found, to his astonishment,
that the wreckage had actually been discovered in April 1977.

**Flashing back to 25 April 1977Y at on Mount Punggur **Two wiry men
dressed in shabby clothes lead a squad of airmen and their officer, Lt.
Sulaiman, through a forested hillside to the wreckage of RI-002. The
airmen set up camp and search the area. They find fragments of a wing
with the faded letters: RI-00, other airplane parts, including a dynamo
with a bullet wedged between the windings and armature. There are a few
fragments of human remains, which the soldiers reverently dig from the
earth and carefully wrap in cloth. They also find two empty wooden
crates labeled: "Gold", but a thorough search of the area does not find
any trace of the treasure itself.

**20 July 1977Y at at Tanjung Karang air base **Five coffins draped in
Indonesian flags lay on a platform in an otherwise empty hanger. A sixth
coffin, larger than the rest and without a flag, rests on a separate
platform. A flatbed truck pulls into the hanger and a squad of airmen,
in silence, pick up each of the flag-draped coffins and place them on
the truck. But they leave the sixth coffin where it lies as the truck
pulls away.

**25 September 1988Y at in the Muharto residence **Muharto tells Cameron
that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bobs remains, could not be
buried with the others because he was a foreigner. Muharto's expression
as he finishes his reminiscences convinces Cameron that he regarded
Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking closure about his mysterious
disappearance. As Cameron rises to leave, Muharto wonders that if he had
turned down promotion and had been with Bob on the final flight, maybe
it would not have ended in tragedy.

**The following day at in the Jakarta Post newsroom **Cameron writes up
the interview, and gives it to managing editor Sabam Siagian, who had
given him the assignment. Sabam glances at the copy, grunts, then passes
the pages to Syd Jardine, the senior copy editor. Syd reads it
carefully, then remarks that Freeberg comes off as a "super-pilot" and
not believable. He suggests Cameron find other accounts of Bob by
researching in the reference section of the newly opened National
Library.

**The following day at in the National Library **Cameron uses his
Jakarta Post credentials to enter the reference section. Julia
Suryakusuma, the only staffer speaking fluent English, is assigned to
fetch the material he needs from the stacks. Julia returns with an
armload of books, and Cameron begins reading. Skimming through the
supplementary background material Julia selected, Cameron's attention is
drawn to a passage in a book by British diplomat John Coast about
meeting Bob in Bukittinggi.

**Flashing back to 08 May 1948Y at in Bukittinggi **John Coast and Dave
Fowler watch as the starboard landing gear on RI-002 slowly collapses
from hydraulic system failure. Bob emerges from the cockpit and admits
that the craft is suffering from the wear-and-tear of past months,
especially repeated landings on rough jungle airstrips. But he is
waiting for the Indonesians to pay him the huge debt they owe so he can
do the much-needed repairs. Coast tells Bob that he is welcome to fly
for his company, POAS, if RI-002 becomes too dangerous. Bob thanks him,
but insists that he will find a way to fix his beloved Dakota.

**28 September 1988Y at in the National Library **After hours of
research, Cameron asks Julia where he can get a cup of coffee. Julia
invites him to join her at the library canteen. Julia tells Cameron of
her dream of securing a scholarship to pursue post-graduate studies in
America. Cameron attempts, in turn, to tell of his dreams of becoming an
international investigative journalist. But Julia stops him, saying,
with a mischievious smile, that if she wants to know anything about him
she will simply ask her father, who is a senior officer in military
intelligence.

**03 October 1988Y at in the Jakarta Post newsroom **Muharto visits to
personally thank Sabam and Cameron for the article, and to tell them
that he has been bombarded with calls from old friends asking about what
happened to the gold. Syd Jardine says that since unloading a quarter
ton of gold would require considerable resources, discovering who might
have had the motivation and ability to transport and sell the gold could
solve the mystery of RI-002. Muharto agrees, and Cameron eagerly offers
to help. Sabam gives his grudging assent, but reminds Cameron that the
Jakarta Post cannot be involved, and he must to any research on his own
time.
