In June 1947, American naval veteran Bob Freeberg lands a war surplus
Dakota on a beach in Java. The villagers are hospitable, if astounded,
but soldiers believe he is a spy. He replies with the only words they
might understand, a name: "Captain Petit Muharto"

-   2In September 1988, American freelance journalist Cameron Bishop
    interviews Petit Muharto for the Jakarta Times, a local
    English-language newspaper. Muharto tells Cameron of the s urprise
    call he received in June 1947 at Maguwo airbase in Jogja, informing
    him that a foreign pilot had landed on a beach in west Java and is
    calling his name. Air Commander Suryadarma orders Muharto to fly to
    the location to investigate. In the air Muharto remembers the
    blockade run he had organized two months previously, which included
    a test landing on a disused airstrip and dropping paratroopers into
    a highland valley. He decides the intrepid pilot must be Bob
    Freeberg, the captain of that memorable blockade run.

Muharto learns that he is correct when he meets army lieutenant Pang
Soeparto and they drive to the beach. Muharto and Pang convince the
local residents to weave bamboo into mats to build a runway which will
enable the aircraft to take off and fly to Maguwo.

In Maguwo, Suryadarma gives the Dakota a f ictitious registration as
RI-002 and a cargo of quinine to sell in Manila. En route Muharto tells
his nervous comrades to follow Bob's example and just do their job, c
ome what may .

They have difficulty finding a buyer for the quinine, and only return
late September on a non-stop flight . For the next year, RI-002 becomes
the Republican lifeline , a boring job enlivened by thrilling moments,
such as when Bob flew i nto a severe storm to evade a Dutch patrol.

On the ground, Bob was treated like a hero by the common people of
Jogja, which often caused embarrassment, like when he was offered the l
ast can of corned beef in the dining room of the Hotel Merdeka. But the
nation's top diplomats and technocrats treated him with equal admiration
when he fly them to a UN conference .

In 1948, Muharto grew concerned that Bob was graying because of the
demands of the missions and the danger. In May 1948 Muharto was promoted
and reassigned to a desk. He last saw Bob when he was l oading a gold
cargo on 30 September 1948. The following day, he was reported missing.

In 1988, Muharto tells Cameron of his i nitial searches of Air Force
archives and the report from the c rash site investigation He tears up
when describing the heroes funeral of the crew, while Bob's remains were
kept in a warehouse. He finishes by saying how he r egrets his decision
to accept the promotion and and leave Bob to face the challenges alone.
\* 2Syd Jardine, a retired foreign correspondent, edits Cameron 's first
draft, then sends him to the library for additional research. Julia
Suryakusuma, a recent university graduate and the only intern fluet in
English, finds the material he needs. Cameron reads how in 1948 British
freebooting pilot Richard Cobley accuse d Bob of monopolizing blockade
run contracts. After finishing his research, Cameron and Julia go for
coffee , and Cameron learns that her father is a military intelligence
officer. \* 2After the article is published, Muharto visits the Jakarta
Times to thank Cameron for the story and pick up extra copies to show to
former Air Force officers. Many of his old colleagues have asked him
about the missing gold, and urge him to research the mystery. Muharto
tells of his frustrations as he attempts to i nvestigate the mystery in
previous years. Cameron offers to help him give it another try. S yd
offers advice on how to approach the research and cautions Cameron to be
wary of what he might uncover in the process.

-   2Cameron returns to the library, where Julia agrees to help with the
    project. She finds a newspaper articles from October 1948 in which
    Spoor claims he has no clue what happened to RI-002. Julia thinks he
    was lying, and suggests they talk to Victor de Jong, one of the many
    Dutch military recruits who elected to remain in Indonesia and take
    citizenship after independence.

-   2Cameron Interviews Victor at the IPPHOS photo agency, which he
    manages. Victor describes how Spoor rages when reading reports of
    RI-002, especially when, in October 1948, Thai authorities released
    Freeberg after detaining him in Bangkok at the request of the Dutch.
    Julia notices a p hoto of a beautiful young Indonesian female artist
    named Emeria Soenassa, but Victor snatches it away. After the
    interview, Cameron offers Julia a ride to the Hotel Hilton, where he
    meets her friends , who are all daughters of senior military
    officers or government officials. Julia's friends urge her to get
    better acquainted with Cameron, whom they assume to be rich because
    he rides a Harley Davidson, so that she can realize her dream of
    studying overseas. However, two days afterward Julia's father,
    Colonel Eddy, Warns Julia about dating a foreigner.

-   2Muharto and Cameron interview Pang Suparto . He tells amusing
    stories of their months in Manila in 1947. Pang tells Cameron that
    on the approach to Manila, Bob asked Muharto to take the co-pilot
    seat to s et the flaps , but in his nervousness had pushed the
    levers too far, almost sending the Dakota into a steep dive. But
    after landing, Muharto redeemed himself by falsely identifies
    himself as p ilot officer to aviation authorities, so Freeberg would
    not be fined from operating a Dakota on an international flight with
    only one qualified pilot.

Pang explains that he, Muharto, and Boedi became instant celebrities .
This attracted the attention of Dutch diplomats, who tooki them to court
to claim the q uinine . On the day they w in the quinine Case , another
blockade runner c rashes while approaching Maguwo. During the long wait
for a buyer for the quinine, Bob supported them , as the duty of a
captain to his crew. Though penniless, they had contacts at the highest
levels of government and the military. Pang and Muharto acted as de
facto military liaison with the Philippines military, arranging to have
Captain Ignatius Espina seconded to the Republic to train guerrilla
fighters. But when Pang Mentions Ining , Muharto stops the interview.

    stories of missions Muharto missed, like dropping Paratroopers over
    Kalimantan in October 1947 and being g rounded in Bangkok . He
    finishes by mentioning how highly Soekarno regarded Bob, calling him
    Our American Friend . Before they leave, Cameron admires Boedi's
    extensive art collection, including paintings by Affandi, the
    nation's leading painter. Boedi suggests Cameron visit Affandi if he
    ever goes to Jogja.

-   2Syd invites Cameron to the Earthquake Bar to meet Sanyoto, the
    owner and long-time friend. Sanyoto had been the Air Force drill
    sergeant during the early years of independence. His erstwhile
    cadets, now top-ranked officers and government officials, have made
    the Earthquake their watering hole. Sanyoto introduces Cameron to
    Sudaryono , who tells of the struggles to turn village boys who had
    barely seen an airplane into qualified pilots.

-   2Cameron meets Samuel Quiko, a noted keroncong musician, at the
    Earthquake. He mentions this to Julia, who recognizes the name and
    finds him mentioned and photographed in 1947 newspapers. In some
    photos he is with Emeria, the painter. Julia suggests they interview
    him, but Cameron dismisses the idea. A few days later, Julia
    interviews Samuel Quiko herself, who tells her about the dangers of
    the Bersiap period and how Samuel sought to prove his patriotism by
    acting as a courier between Republicans and sympathetic Dutch
    nationals. He mentions frequenting Emeria's salon, and suggests

    RI-002 missions. George watced Ining training the student militia,
    and was disturbed by the contempt he showed for the young fighters,
    and his constant requests for whiskey. At the end of November, Ining
    writes a letter to Primitivo asking to return to the Philippines,
    but is too late to give it to Muharto for delivery. Ining is clearly
    distraught, but George must remain at his post. He asks Mas Ded,
    Muharto's brother, to take Ining home and look after him. The
    following morning George awakens to the shocking news that both
    Ining and Mas Ded were found dead in the house on Jalan Jetis.

    English-language newspaper. Muharto tells Cameron of the s urprise
    call he received in June 1947 at Maguwo airbase in Jogja, informing
    him that a foreign pilot had landed on a beach in west Java and is
    calling his name. Air Commander Suryadarma orders Muharto to fly to
    the location to investigate. In the air Muharto remembers the
    blockade run he had organized two months previously, which included
    a test landing on a disused airstrip and dropping paratroopers into
    a highland valley. He decides the intrepid pilot must be Bob
    Freeberg, the captain of that memorable blockade run.

Muharto learns that he is correct when he meets army lieutenant Pang
Soeparto and they drive to the beach. Muharto and Pang convince the
local residents to weave bamboo into mats to build a runway which will
enable the aircraft to take off and fly to Maguwo.

In Maguwo, Suryadarma gives the Dakota a f ictitious registration as
RI-002 and a cargo of quinine to sell in Manila. En route Muharto tells
his nervous comrades to follow Bob's example and just do their job, c
ome what may .

They have difficulty finding a buyer for the quinine, and only return
late September on a non-stop flight . For the next year, RI-002 becomes
the Republican lifeline , a boring job enlivened by thrilling moments,
such as when Bob flew i nto a severe storm to evade a Dutch patrol.

On the ground, Bob was treated like a hero by the common people of
Jogja, which often caused embarrassment, like when he was offered the l
ast can of corned beef in the dining room of the Hotel Merdeka. But the
nation's top diplomats and technocrats treated him with equal admiration
when he fly them to a UN conference .

In 1948, Muharto grew concerned that Bob was graying because of the
demands of the missions and the danger. In May 1948 Muharto was promoted
and reassigned to a desk. He last saw Bob when he was l oading a gold
cargo on 30 September 1948. The following day, he was reported missing.

In 1988, Muharto tells Cameron of his i nitial searches of Air Force
archives and the report from the c rash site investigation He tears up
when describing the heroes funeral of the crew, while Bob's remains were
kept in a warehouse. He finishes by saying how he r egrets his decision
to accept the promotion and and leave Bob to face the challenges alone.
\* 2Syd Jardine, a retired foreign correspondent, edits Cameron 's first
draft, then sends him to the library for additional research. Julia
Suryakusuma, a recent university graduate and the only intern fluet in
English, finds the material he needs. Cameron reads how in 1948 British
freebooting pilot Richard Cobley accuse d Bob of monopolizing blockade
run contracts. After finishing his research, Cameron and Julia go for
coffee , and Cameron learns that her father is a military intelligence
officer. \* 2After the article is published, Muharto visits the Jakarta
Times to thank Cameron for the story and pick up extra copies to show to
former Air Force officers. Many of his old colleagues have asked him
about the missing gold, and urge him to research the mystery. Muharto
tells of his frustrations as he attempts to i nvestigate the mystery in
previous years. Cameron offers to help him give it another try. S yd
offers advice on how to approach the research and cautions Cameron to be
wary of what he might uncover in the process.

    named Emeria Soenassa, but Victor snatches it away. After the
    interview, Cameron offers Julia a ride to the Hotel Hilton, where he
    meets her friends , who are all daughters of senior military
    officers or government officials. Julia's friends urge her to get
    better acquainted with Cameron, whom they assume to be rich because
    he rides a Harley Davidson, so that she can realize her dream of
    studying overseas. However, two days afterward Julia's father,
    Colonel Eddy, Warns Julia about dating a foreigner.

-   2Muharto and Cameron interview Pang Suparto . He tells amusing
    stories of their months in Manila in 1947. Pang tells Cameron that
    on the approach to Manila, Bob asked Muharto to take the co-pilot
    seat to s et the flaps , but in his nervousness had pushed the
    levers too far, almost sending the Dakota into a steep dive. But
    after landing, Muharto redeemed himself by falsely identifies
    himself as p ilot officer to aviation authorities, so Freeberg would
    not be fined from operating a Dakota on an international flight with
    only one qualified pilot.

Pang explains that he, Muharto, and Boedi became instant celebrities .
This attracted the attention of Dutch diplomats, who tooki them to court
to claim the q uinine . On the day they w in the quinine Case , another
blockade runner c rashes while approaching Maguwo. During the long wait
for a buyer for the quinine, Bob supported them , as the duty of a
captain to his crew. Though penniless, they had contacts at the highest
levels of government and the military. Pang and Muharto acted as de

Captain Ignatius Espina seconded to the Republic to train guerrilla
fighters. But when Pang Mentions Ining , Muharto stops the interview.

    and was disturbed by the contempt he showed for the young fighters,
    and his constant requests for whiskey. At the end of November, Ining
    writes a letter to Primitivo asking to return to the Philippines,
    but is too late to give it to Muharto for delivery. Ining is clearly
    distraught, but George must remain at his post. He asks Mas Ded,
    Muharto's brother, to take Ining home and look after him. The
    following morning George awakens to the shocking news that both
    Ining and Mas Ded were found dead in the house on Jalan Jetis.

RI-002 and a cargo of quinine to sell in Manila. En route Muharto tells
his nervous comrades to follow Bob's example and just do their job, c
ome what may .

They have difficulty finding a buyer for the quinine, and only return
late September on a non-stop flight . For the next year, RI-002 becomes
the Republican lifeline , a boring job enlivened by thrilling moments,
such as when Bob flew i nto a severe storm to evade a Dutch patrol.

On the ground, Bob was treated like a hero by the common people of
Jogja, which often caused embarrassment, like when he was offered the l

nation's top diplomats and technocrats treated him with equal admiration
when he fly them to a UN conference .

In 1948, Muharto grew concerned that Bob was graying because of the
demands of the missions and the danger. In May 1948 Muharto was promoted
and reassigned to a desk. He last saw Bob when he was l oading a gold
cargo on 30 September 1948. The following day, he was reported missing.

In 1988, Muharto tells Cameron of his i nitial searches of Air Force
archives and the report from the c rash site investigation He tears up
when describing the heroes funeral of the crew, while Bob's remains were
kept in a warehouse. He finishes by saying how he r egrets his decision
to accept the promotion and and leave Bob to face the challenges alone.
\* 2Muharto and Cameron interview Pang Suparto . He tells amusing
stories of their months in Manila in 1947. Pang tells Cameron that on
the approach to Manila, Bob asked Muharto to take the co-pilot seat to s
et the flaps , but in his nervousness had pushed the levers too far,
almost sending the Dakota into a steep dive. But after landing, Muharto
redeemed himself by falsely identifies himself as p ilot officer to
aviation authorities, so Freeberg would not be fined from operating a
Dakota on an international flight with only one qualified pilot.

Pang explains that he, Muharto, and Boedi became instant celebrities .
This attracted the attention of Dutch diplomats, who tooki them to court
to claim the q uinine . On the day they w in the quinine Case , another
blockade runner c rashes while approaching Maguwo. During the long wait
for a buyer for the quinine, Bob supported them , as the duty of a
captain to his crew. Though penniless, they had contacts at the highest
levels of government and the military. Pang and Muharto acted as de
facto military liaison with the Philippines military, arranging to have
Captain Ignatius Espina seconded to the Republic to train guerrilla
fighters. But when Pang Mentions Ining , Muharto stops the interview.

    interviews Petit Muharto for the Jakarta Times, a local
    English-language newspaper. Muharto tells Cameron of the s urprise
    call he received in June 1947 at Maguwo airbase in Jogja, informing
    him that a foreign pilot had landed on a beach in west Java and is
    calling his name. Air Commander Suryadarma orders Muharto to fly to
    the location to investigate. In the air Muharto remembers the
    blockade run he had organized two months previously, which included
    a test landing on a disused airstrip and dropping paratroopers into
    a highland valley. He decides the intrepid pilot must be Bob
    Freeberg, the captain of that memorable blockade run.

Muharto learns that he is correct when he meets army lieutenant Pang
Soeparto and they drive to the beach. Muharto and Pang convince the
local residents to weave bamboo into mats to build a runway which will
enable the aircraft to take off and fly to Maguwo.

newspaper. Muharto tells Cameron of the s urprise call he received in
June 1947 at Maguwo airbase in Jogja, informing him that a foreign pilot
had landed on a beach in west Java and is calling his name. Air
Commander Suryadarma orders Muharto to fly to the location to
investigate. In the air Muharto remembers the blockade run he had
organized two months previously, which included a test landing on a
disused airstrip and dropping paratroopers into a highland valley. He
decides the intrepid pilot must be Bob Freeberg, the captain of that
memorable blockade run.

Muharto learns that he is correct when he meets army lieutenant Pang
Soeparto and they drive to the beach. Muharto and Pang convince the
local residents to weave bamboo into mats to build a runway which will
enable the aircraft to take off and fly to Maguwo.

In Maguwo, Suryadarma gives the Dakota a f ictitious registration as
RI-002 and a cargo of quinine to sell in Manila. En route Muharto tells
his nervous comrades to follow Bob's example and just do their job, c
ome what may .

They have difficulty finding a buyer for the quinine, and only return
late September on a non-stop flight . For the next year, RI-002 becomes
the Republican lifeline , a boring job enlivened by thrilling moments,
such as when Bob flew i nto a severe storm to evade a Dutch patrol.

On the ground, Bob was treated like a hero by the common people of
Jogja, which often caused embarrassment, like when he was offered the l
ast can of corned beef in the dining room of the Hotel Merdeka. But the
nation's top diplomats and technocrats treated him with equal admiration
when he fly them to a UN conference .

In 1948, Muharto grew concerned that Bob was graying because of the
demands of the missions and the danger. In May 1948 Muharto was promoted
and reassigned to a desk. He last saw Bob when he was l oading a gold
cargo on 30 September 1948. The following day, he was reported missing.

In 1988, Muharto tells Cameron of his i nitial searches of Air Force
archives and the report from the c rash site investigation He tears up
when describing the heroes funeral of the crew, while Bob's remains were
kept in a warehouse. He finishes by saying how he r egrets his decision
to accept the promotion and and leave Bob to face the challenges alone.
