**Landing At Cilotok - 8 June 1947**:  Bob Freeberg lands his unmarked
Dakota cargo plane on this remote beach in southwest Java, the huge
aircraft shuddering to a stop a few meters from a rocky bluff.
Villagers appear, marveling at this colossus from the sky. They are
friendly and offer Bob and his two Filipino crew members food and a
place to sleep. But the following morning, Indonesian soldiers appear.
One points to the lack of registration on the Dakotas tail and shouts
"*Mata-Mata*!", "Spy!" They point their rifles directly at Bob. He
replies with the only words they might understand, a name: "Captain
Petit Muharto".

**Surprise message - 08 June 1947**:  Muharto is surprised to be given a
message from Army Lieutenant Pang Soeparto, stationed in Tasikmalaya,
informing him that a foreign pilot had landed an unmarked cargo aircraft
on a nearby beach and, astoundingly, had asked for Muharto by name.
Muharto takes this information to his commander, Suryadarma, who tells
him to fly to Tasikmalaya and find out which of Muharto's "foreign
flyboy friends" it might be.

**On The Nikosoren - 28 June 1988**:  Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasikmalaya in a Nikosoren, was one of a score barely serviceable planes the Japanese had left behind. The air force mechanics kept these aircraft flying through skill and guesswork, but Muharto was aware that any flight could end in disaster. To keep his mind from this eventuality, Muharto had thought about the American pilots he had met during the blockade runs he had organized from Singapore to Jogjakarta. He  decided that only Bob Freeberg possessed the skill and nerve to land at night on a remote beach. Bob had been the pilot of the third blockade run. Though these had been standard charter flights -- they even had a flight attendant, a lovely Filipina named Miss Brown -- the third flight had tested Freeberg's skills to the limit.   

**Third CALI Run - 31 March 1947**:  Amid poor
visibility over Java, Bob demonstrates his piloting skill by diving
through a break in the clouds, leveling off under the cloud cover a few
hundred meters above the ground. Muharto spots a railway line, and tells
Bob that it leads along the valley to terminate in Jogja. Bob follows
the line, barely visible through the rain, and jokingly asks Muharto if
there are any tunnels between here the Jogja. The look on Muharto's face
suggests that he is not entirely sure. 


**Landing At Karangendah - 31 March 1947**:  On the return leg to Singapore, Muharto asks Bob if he
can attempt a landing on a refurbished Japanese airstrip at Karangendah.
Bob readily agrees. They circle the strip and Bob ponders the attempt.
Muharto asks if he can land a plane this size. Bob replies that he did
this all the time in the war. He can "land on a dime and give you a
nickel change." 

Bob makes a spectacular landing, engines roaring with reverse thrust. Muharto asks if he can take off again. Bob replies:
"I hope so. We seem to be smack dab in the middle of nowhere." 

Santoso, the base commander climbs aboard to meet them. After a short conversation, Santoso exits, and Bob takes off, the wheels finally lifting off the runway a few meters before the tree line.


**Muharto Meets Pang - 28 June 1988**:  Muharto tells Cameron that when he reached Tasik, Pang Soeparto told him
that the mystery pilot was indeed Freeberg, and that he had narrowly
missed being shot as a spy. Now the danger had been that a passing Dutch
patrol could spot the Dakota at any time. They loaded two barrels of
aviation fuel in a jeep and headed for the beach.


**Off The Beach - 09 June 1947**:  Muharto recognizes Freeberg as the pilot of a previous blockade run that Muharto had organized. Muharto and Pang
marvel that Freeberg had been able to land on this short stretch of
beach, bookended by high bluffs.  Fearing that a patrolling Dutch fighter could appear
at any time, Muharto, in a stirring speech, implores the assembled
villagers to tear apart their houses to fashion an improvised runway
from the bamboo mats used as walls. They do so, and with Muharto and
Pang on board, the Dakota takes off and flies to Maguwo.


**Fictitious Registration - 10 June 1947**:  Suryadarma commissions Bob to
fly a cargo of high-value quinine to Manila and return with essential
medicines and spare parts. Suryadarma assigns Muharto as mission leader, and tells Pang Soeparto to accompany them, as the quinine is the property of the army. He also assigns a young airman, Boediardjo, a Dutch-and-English-speaking graduate of a technical college, as radio operator.  Muharto expresses concern about the reception
that might await unmarked aircraft carrying high-value goods into
Manila. He suggests that they paint a fictitious registration number, RI-002,
Bob says it should be RI-001, as
his is the first aircraft. Suryadarma, imperiously, states that RI-001
is reserved for a future presidential aircraft. Bob grumbles as
Suryadarma issues the order to paint the number on the Dakota's tail. 

**Come What May - 10 June 1947**:  Muharto, Pang and Boedi worry about the reception they might face in Manila. Muharto shows his comrades the rudimentary chart that Bob used to navigate to Java, which shows important navigational landmarks as mere specks in the ocean. He tells the others that if Bob can dare to take risks for what he believes then so can we. 


**Into The Typhoon - 15 November 1947**:  In the co-pilot seat, Muharto spots an small airplane near the horizon
as they fly near Dutch territory. This is most likely a Dutch fighter on
patrol, so Bob steers RI-002 into a tropical storm. Boedi grins when he
sees Muharto's terrified face as the Dakota is violently buffeted, with
sickening plunges in altitude. Bob tells Muharto to not worry; when a
Navy test pilot he would fly through typhoons.

**Mission To Bagiuo - 30 November 1947**:  Bob flies a team of
Republican officials and technocrats from Maguwo to a United Nation's
conference in the Philippines to make the case for Indonesian
independence. These highly educated, cosmopolitan men treat Bob with the
same great respect as do the common people of Jogja.

**Kalimantan Paratroopers - 17 October 1947**:  Bob and Boedi fly ten paratroopers to be dropped
near an insurgent stronghold in the forests of Kalimantan. None have
jumped before, or even been in a aircraft, so tension is high. There is
an uproar as the parachute of one trooper opens and dumps onto the cabin
floor. The trooper swears it was an accident, but all others accuse him
of cowardice. The troopers look at each other, wondering if any one will
be next. Boedi enters the cabin. Though he is only an airman, the
charismatic Boedi takes command of the situation, assuring the troopers
that Bob has much wartime experience flying paratroopers and will drop
them safely. He goes to the cockpit and talks with Bob for a moment. The
Bob turns the aircraft over to his co pilot, leaves his seat and stands
in the doorway, his body filling the frame. With Boedi translating, Bob
assures the troops that he has done this many times during the war, and
will drop them exactly where they can make a safe landing. Emboldened by Bob's air
of quiet competence, each trooper moves forward and shakes his hand.
Bob returns to his seat. After minutes later, the dropmaster issues the command to jump, and
the cabin empties, save for the dropmaster and a lone recruit wondering
what fate is in store for him back at Maguwo. Boedi watches as the
parachutes drift down and land are enveloped by the endless forest, then
asks Bob how many paradrops he made. Bob grins and answers: "None.
I was a Navy pilot. All my missions were over water."


**Grounded In Bangkok - 20 October 1947**:  Bob flies two Indonesian aviators, Halim and Iswandi,
to Thailand to purchase a twin-prop airplane that will
become RI-003. Dutch authorities pressure the Thai government to detain
Freeberg as a blockade runner. The Thais briefly detain Freeberg in a
comfortable hotel room, but the Indonesian crew must find their own
accommodation. They can only afford rooms in a bar district. Boedi is
delighted, but Halim and Iswandi are appalled. Both are engaged to be
married, and worry that the families of their fianc√©es will learn that
they have stayed in such a disreputable environment.


**Not Ready for Airplanes - 07 May 1948**:  Bob waits in the pre-dawn gloom for Bambang and the
crew to show up for an opium run that must be completed before sunrise. It is well after dawn, when they drive up, laughing and
joking. Bob is furious, but keeps his voice measured, telling Bambang
and the others that they are "Not Ready for Airplanes", jumping
into their automobile and telling the driver to take him back to the Hotel Merdeka.

**Airworthiness Issues - 29 December 1947**:  RI-002 flies Ining's remains to Manila by way to Pekanbaru to drop off Republican
officials. Bad weather over
Pekanbaru forces RI-002 to divert to Singapore. Dutch representatives on
the island pressure the British into grounding the Dakota because of
"airworthiness" issues.

**Finally To Manila - 15 January 1948**:  British officials open Ining's coffin, searching for
contraband. Finding none, and with RI-002 brought up to minimal
airworthiness standards, they grant Bob permission to depart, to the
great annoyance of the Dutch.

**The American Friend - 21 June 1948**:  During a speech on an airstrip, Soekarno stands on the
RI-002 wing and speaks to a small, enthralled crowd of local residents.
Toward the end of the speech, Soekarno points to Bob in the cockpit,
proclaiming: "This is Bob Freeberg, a brave, good man and a friend of
all Indonesians"

**Contract Aviator - 01 July 1948**:  Suryadarma orders Bob to Sumatra on another mission. Bob refuses, and infuriates Suryadarma by flying to Manila that day.

**Landing Gear Collapse - 04 May 1948**:  The landing gear collapses just as RI-002 is
powering up for take off . Bob checks the wing
for damage, and decides that the new crack in not serious. Later that
morning, after impromptu repairs, he takes off, while Dave Fowler looks on, shaking his head.
