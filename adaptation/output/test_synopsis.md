  Cameron Meets Muharto¶ <#Cameron-Meets-Muharto>

In September 1988, Cameron Bishop, an American journalism grad student
interning as a language consultant at The Jakarta Post, pleads with
editor Sabam Siagian to be allowed to investigate and write stories.
Sabam explains, yet again, that this not allowed. Instead, he assigns
Cameron to write a puff piece about his friend Petit Muharto's
experiences flying blockade runs with American mercenary Bob Freeburg
during Indonesia's post-war struggle for independence. Cameron meets
Muharto at his tidy home in south Jakarta. The retired Air Force officer
tells of meeting Freeberg when the latter had made an emergency landing
on a remote beach and of Freeberg being commissioned to fly for the
Republic with the fictitious registration of RI-002. Muharto emphasizes
the value of the blockade runs to the struggle for independence, and the
respect and affection Bob received from all Indonesians, from President
Soekarno to the common people of Jogjakarta. Muharto says he flew with
Freeberg until May 1948, when he was promoted to major and assigned to
headquarters. Four months later, Muharto was devastated to learn that
RI-002 had vanished while transporting Republican gold from Java to
safety in Sumatra ahead of an expected Dutch invasion. The RI-002
wreckage was found on a mountain in Sumatra in 1977. The gold was
missing, and the mystery of the disappearance was never solved.


  Cameron Meets Victor¶ <#Cameron-Meets-Victor>

Cameron shows the draft of his story to his workmate Syd Jardine, a
chain-smoking, alcoholic former foreign correspondent in his early
sixties. Syd edits the piece with practiced aplomb, and hands it back.
He tells Cameron that it should have a photo of Freeberg himself (which
Muharto does not have) and suggests he contact his friend Victor de Jong
at the IPPHOS photo agency.

The IPPHOS office is in a building one inspection away from being
condemned. Cameron meets Victor, a Dutch army conscript who defected to
the Indonesian side in the final days of the struggle. Victor finds a
photo of Freeberg after a short search, and insists that Victor stay for
coffee so he can tell him the Dutch side of the Freeberg story, which he
witness first-hand while posted in the office of General Simon Spoor,
the commander of all colonial military forces.


  Muharto Visits Post¶ <#Muharto-Visits-Post>

The day after publication of the Freeberg story, Muharto visits the Post
to thank Sabam and Cameron personally and pick up extra copies to give
to friends. Muharto tells them ...


  Cameron Meets Julia¶ <#Cameron-Meets-Julia>

At the National Library reference archives, Cameron meets the attendant,
Julia, an attractive, bookish Indonesian woman in her early twenties.
She demonstrates an impressive competence finding the books he requests
in short order, along with related material she thinks might be useful.
Cameron reads about the political situation in post-war Indonesia, and
the high regard the various foreign diplomats, journalists, and
academics felt held for Freeberg. After a couple of hours, Cameron wants
to break for coffee. As no beverages are allowed in the reference
section, Julia escorts him to the staff canteen. Julia tells Cameron
about her desire to take her master's degree in an American university,
and reveals that her father is an army colonel in the intelligence section.


  At The Kuntzkring¶ <#At-The-Kuntzkring>

Cameron visits Victor to learn more about Spoor's efforts to stop the
blockade runs. Instead, Victor tells Cameron of Emiria Soenassa, a
beautiful charismatic painter who fell in love with him after he had
praised her art in a newspaper article.


  Harvard Party¶ <#Harvard-Party>

Sabam gives Cameron his invitation to a reception for visiting Harvard
alumni at the house of Boediardjo, a former Air Force senior officer and
government minister. Cameron learns that this was the same Boediardjo
who served as RI-002 radio operator. At Cameron's urging Boedi regales
his guest with tales of adventure. The guests depart soon after dinner
to catch an early flight, and Boedi invites Cameron to stay so he can
ask him about Muharto's investigations. Boedi also tells Cameron of the
humorous incidents when they were stranded penniless in Manila waiting
to sell the quinine. Boedi pokes affection fun at his former comrade for
his belief that Freeberg's friend Tom Lee would treat them to drinks and
dinner out of kindness for their predicament. However, to Boedi, it had
been obvious that Lee had been an intelligence operative pumping them
for information about the Republic.


  Cameron Dates Julia¶ <#Cameron-Dates-Julia>

Cameron returns to the library for more research. Julia helps by
translating headlines in Dutch newspapers. They discover that they had
both arranged to meet friends at the Hotel Hilton. Cameron offers to
take her there on his Harley Davidson. At the hotel, Julia's friends
tell her to go after Cameron. If he rides a Harley he must be rich. They
tease her by saying thatas the daughter of "Honest Eddy", one of the few
senior army officers who is not corrupt, this would be the only way she
could afford to pay her own bill at this luxury hotel.


  Thugs And Bandits¶ <#Thugs-And-Bandits>


  Portrait Of Emeria¶ <#Portrait-Of-Emeria>

Intrigued by Victor's stories of Emeria, Julia searches the stacks for
articles mentioning her. A portrait emerges of an independent,
charismatic young woman whose mixed parentage of a Dutch businessman and
a Javanese aristocrat and artistic talent grants her entry into all
levels of European and Indonesian society.


  American Surfer¶ <#American-Surfer>

Victor shows Cameron the photo of Robert Koke, and tells of his
suspicion that Koke had been "The Quiet American" in Batavia. Cameron
ties this in with Boedi's assessment of Tom Lee, and comes to the
conclusion that Spoor had been plotting with the newly formed CIA to
overthrow the Republic and take control of the East Indies himself, as
had happened in South Africa.


  George Reuneker Interview¶ <#George-Reuneker-Interview>


  Julia And Ani Bond¶ <#Julia-And-Ani-Bond>

Julia listens, in awe, of Ani recounting of life in Jogja during the
revolution. Ani tells of her growth from a naive teenager thinking only
of making a household to a committed champion of the people,
volunteering to teach and to feed the swelling population of refugees.

  Julia Goes Ballistic¶ <#Julia-Goes-Ballistic>

Colonel Eddy tells Julia of his guilt in not being able to fulfill the
dreams of his only child. He tells Julia to start applying to
universities in Europe and America. When Julia asks where the tuition
money is coming from, Eddy holds up his hand and says: " Beres Sayang ",
meaning she should not worry. Later that evening, Cameron takes Julia to
an expat party in Kemang, and she is mistaken for a bar girl. Julia
takes Cameron to a far corner of the garden and screams at him in fury
and humiliation, saying that all foreigners think Indonesian women who
hang around foreigners are either household servants or hookers.

  Useful Idiot¶ <#Useful-Idiot>

Cameron uses his Jakarta Post credentials to gain access to Julius
Tahija. He asks some perfunctory questions about foreign investment,
then changes the subject to the revolution, and the time Tahija worked
for Spoor. Tahija is surprised at the question, but revels in the
opportunity to relive those exciting times. Cameron mentions Victor.
Tahija grins, and tells Cameron that Victor had been a "Useful Idiot",
an intelligence asset Spoor used to keep tabs on the Republican
intellectuals in Batavian through is supposed clandestine relationship
with Emeria.


  Julia Ragu¶ <#Julia-Ragu>

In an unguarded (and unclothed) moment, Cameron tells Julia about the
Jakarta Post investigations into Army officers seeking to influence the
emerging capital market through leaking false information to pump up
stock values. Julia realizes that this must be the deal her father is
involved in. Julia begs her father not to sully his reputation as
"Honest Eddy" by participating in capital market manipulation, even
though it means she will not be able to study overseas. Eddy replies:
"It's all right. It's not corruption when you take money from foreigners."


  At The Lapo¶ <#At-The-Lapo>

Sabam invites Cameron for a late meal of pork and beer after a hard
night. Sabam tells Cameron the things Syd keeps to himself. He had been
a brilliant foreign correspondent, too busy to settle down, until he met
his Dini, a well-educated, much younger woman from a prominent Padang
family. The family hated him, but they were devoted to each other. Dini
died in a senseless accident, and family swooped in to take the house
and his son. Syd was broken, and never recovered.


  Julia Visits Emeria¶ <#Julia-Visits-Emeria>

During a trip to Jogja with Cameron, Julia slips away and follows a lead
she encountered during her research. As she hoped, she finds Emiria
Soenassa, who has now returned to Indonesia after living in the
Netherlands, married to a Dutch academic. Asked why she abandoned
Victor; Emiria replied that you always have to choose sides.


  Karangendah Raid¶ <#Karangendah-Raid>

Following Sanyoto's instructions and carrying a letter and a bottle of
whiskey, Cameron and Julia find Anwar Congo. The gangster is pleased
with the message and gift from his old friend, and arranges for his two
visitors to be smuggled onto the base at Karangendah, where they confirm
that this wss the location of the photo of RI-002. When they return,
Anwar introduces them to several men who had been employed at
Karangendah in menial civilian jobs. They attest that they had seen the
crew in captivity. However, no one remembers seeing Freeberg.
