Main Timeline September 1988
============================

Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting
with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when
they hear the roar of a large motorcycle approaching. Muharto, in jest,
covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in
front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani
opens it to find Cameron, in jeans and motorcycle boots, asking for
Muharto. Once over his surprise at being interviewed by a "Hell's Angel"
Muharto tells the story of the Bob Freeberg and RI-002, beginning with a
surprise call he received a his desk in Maguwo Air Base in Jogjakarta.

Flashback to June 1947
======================

Muharto receives a telephone call from Pang Suparto, an army officer
serving at a base in Tasikmalaya. about 300 km to the west of
Jogjakarta. Pang tells Muharto that a foreign pilot has landed a C-47
military cargo aircraft on a nearby beach. When Pang, who speaks little
English, questioned the pilot, he asked for Muharto by name.

Muharto reports the surprising call to Suryadarma, the commander of the
Air Force. Suryadarma grins, saying: "Must be one of your foreign
flyboys", and sends Muharto to Tasik to investigate.

Main Timeline September 1988
============================

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit
monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even
seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight,
Muharto says he pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it
must be Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before
when he accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the
Manilia-based CALI charter airline.

Flashback to March 1947
=======================

Bob Freeberg, large, fit man in his mid twenties with a pleasant,
serious demeanor, pilots a CALI blockade run from Singapore to Jogja.
Petit Muharto stands behind the two pilots, staring out the window at
the cloud cover below them, broken by the tips of volcanic cones. In the
featureless cloudscape, Muharto cannot identify the mountains with any
certainty,

As the aircraft is being unloaded and refueled for the return to
Singapore, Muharto introduces Bob to Suryadarma, who thanks him for his
assistance. Then Suryadarma takes Muharto aside and tells him that this
will be his last blockade run. An Indian businessman has offered to link
India with the Republic with his own Dakota, VT-CLA, and has the full
support of the Indian government. Muharto is both pleased at this
display of crucial international support, and dismayed that once again
he will be desk-bound. However, thanks to Bob, his last flight will be a
memorable one.

Before takeoff on the return trip to Singapore, Muharto asks Bob if he
can attempt a landing on a refurbished Japanese airstrip at Karangendah.
Bob readily agrees. They circle the strip and Bob ponders the attempt.
Muharto asks if he can land a plane this size. Bob replies that he did
this all the time in the war. He can "land on a dime and give you a
nickel change." Then Muharto asks if he can take off again. Bob replies:
"I certainly hope so. We seem to be smack dab in the middle of nowhere."

Bob makes a spectacular landing, engines roaring with reverse thrust.
Santoso, the base commander climbs aboard to meet them. After a short
conversation, Santoso exits, and Bob takes off, the wheels finally
lifting off the runway a few meters before the end.

The CALI Dakota flies over the Bukit Barisan mountaintops, and drops
into a valley toward the town of Bukittinggi. At Muharto's direction,
Bob passes low over an airstrip, which is full of potholes and unusable.
The co-pilot leaves his seat and goes to the cargo compartment,
motioning to Miss Brown and Muharto to sit down far from the door. The
two other passengers are donning parachutes and preparing to jump. The
co-pilot wrenches open the door, and scraps of paper and cardboard swirl
as the air stream enters the cabin. The two parachutists jump out the
door. Muharto looks out of the window behind him, sees the parachutists
land squarely on the airstrip, and remarks on Freeberg's piloting
skills.

Main Timeline September 1988
============================

Muharto tells Cameron that he met Pang Suparto at the army base. and
together they take two barrels of aviation fuel to the beach where
Freeberg is stranded. He tells Cameron that when he saw the beach,
bookended by two rivers and the gap between the water and palm trees
scarcely wider than the Dakota's wing span, he knew that only Bob
Freeberg had the skill to make that landing.

Flashback to June 1947
======================

Muharto arrives on Cilotok Beach and sees that the pilot is Bob
Freeberg. Muharto and Pang rally the local villagers to construct an
emergency runway of bamboo matting, and Freeberg's Dakota takes off and
flies to Jogja.

The Dakota lands in Jogjakarta, where Suryadarma commissions Bob to fly
a cargo of high-value quinine to Manila and return with essential
medicines and spare parts. The war-surplus Dakota is still unregistered,
so to forestall potential problems with Philippine authorities, Muharto
suggests that the designation RI-002 be painted on the tail. Bob
protests that since his is the first aircraft registered by Indonesia,
it should be RI-001. Suryadarma explains the RI-001 is being held in
reserve for a future presidential aircraft, which cannot be owned by a
foreigner.

Flashback to July 1947
======================

Bob invites Muharto to sit in co-pilot seat and assist him with the flap
controls during the final approach to Manila. But when Bob gives the
command, the nervous Muharto pushed the levers to full, causing the
Dakota lurch downward. Bob instantly repositions the levers, and gently
reminds Muharto to not pass the half-flaps setting until they see the
runway.

Flashback to June 1947 {#flashback-to-june-1947-3}
======================

At the airport, Muharto falsely identifies himself as co-pilot, thereby
saving Bob from an infraction of aviation regulations.

Muharto stays with Bob's friend Tom Lee, a government lawyer. Over
breakfast, Tom reads the newspaper headlines about "Fearless Bob
Freeberg" and his "Javanese Crew". One article reports that the Dutch
are laying claim to the valuable quinine cargo as the "Javanese Crew"
are "subjects of the Dutch Queen".

Salipada Penatun, who is also a sitting senator with extensive
high-level contacts, lays out the legal justification for ownership of
the quinine, then lets Muharto give an impassioned plea, claiming that
the money from selling the quinine will buy medicines and other
essentials unavailable in the besieged capital. The Dutch counter by
calling a plantation expert to testify that the Republic does not have
the capability to process quinine, so the drug must have been produced
in a Dutch-owed factory before the war. Muharto jumps to his feet, ready
to protest this insult to his people's technological skill, but Penatun
motions for him to sit down, then calmly tells the judge: "A foreigner
is not qualified to discuss the internal matters of the sovereign
Republic of Indonesia." The judge considers this, obviously with some
sympathy, and adjourns the session.

Flashback to August 1947
========================

As they wait for a buyer for the quinine Muharto, Boedi, and Pang eat a
single meal each day, all at the cheapest restaurant they can find:
Madras Curry. Some days Bob joins them and pays the bill, inisting that
he is responsible for their well-being until he returns them safely to
Java.

Flashback to July 1947
======================

Bob invites Muharto and Boedi to his apartment for dinner and drinks to
celebrate their victory in court and plan their next moves. Bob says
that he and a partner in Singapore are setting up Southeastern airlines.
With two more aircraft, Bob can set up scheduled blockade runs between
Manila, Bangkok and Jogja, like a regular airline. Boedi turns on Bob's
shortwave radio and searches for news broadcasts from the Indies. Then
they listen in horror to reports that VT-CLA, an Indian-registered
Dakota that had made many blockade runs, had been shot down on approach
to Maguwo. Muharto turns to Bob and asks if he is still willing to aid
the Republic by flying through the blockade at the risk of being shot
down. Bob nods.

Flashback to September 1947
===========================

One day, Muharto attempts to pay for their meals at Madras Curry,
explaining that it is an honorarium for a talk to a group of the lady
lawyers. To his surprise, Bob chastises him for "taking money for
nothing".

Flashback to July 1947
======================

Muharto wins quinine case. Dutch are pissed.

Flashback to September 1947
===========================

RI-002 returns to Jogja, flying non-stop to conceal the presence of
Captain Espina. They reach Java after dusk, with landmarks difficult to
discern in the gloom. After some hesitation, during which tension rises
in the cockpit, Muharto draws upon a vivid schoolboy memory to identify
a range of hills and guides the aircraft to Jogja.

Flashback to October 1947
=========================

Muharto takes Bob to meet Soekarno At the presidential palace. As was
his custom in private conversation, Soekarno treats Bob as an equal and
urges him to stay and help the struggle.

Flashback to November 1947
==========================

Bob invites Muharto to join him for dinner at the Hotel Merdeka. He is
embarrassed when a waiter insists he be served the last can of American
corned beef left behind by visiting United Nations officials.

Freeberg, Muharto and Boedi fly Republican economists and other experts
to Manila to meet with United Nations representatives in the hill town
of Baguio. The delegates, who are all prominent figures in the Republic
and have cosmopolitan backgrounds, treat Bob with as much respect as do
the hero-worshipping common people of Jogja.

Main Timeline September 1988
============================

Muharto tells Cameron that the situation was so chaotic, with the Dutch
threatening to invade the Republic, that a proper search of the rugged
terrain on the flight path was not possible. A few years previously
Muharto had began his own investigations in AURI archives, finding the
report of the team sent to investigate the crash site.

Flashback to April 1977
=======================

Two wiry men dressed in shabby clothes lead a squad of airmen and their
officer, Lt. Sulaiman, through a forested hillside to the wreckage of
RI-002. The airmen set up camp and search the area. They find fragments
of a wing with the faded letters: RI-00, other airplane parts, including
a dynamo with a bullet wedged between the windings and armature. They
also find two empty wooden crates labeled with name of a gold mine in
Java, but a thorough search of the area does not find any trace of the
gold itself. The airmen dig through the earth around the wreckage,
finding unidentifiable fragments of human remains. With great reverence,
they clean the soil from the remains, wrap them in clean, white cloth
and place them in a backpack. Sulaiman takes a last look around the
site, then orders his men to pack up and leave, taking with them the
remains and pieces of wreckage small enough to carry.

Flashback to July 1977
======================

In an otherwise empty hanger, five coffins draped in Indonesian flags
lay on a platform. A sixth coffin, larger than the rest and without a
flag, rests on a separate platform. A flatbed truck pulls into the
hanger and a squad of airmen, in silence, pick up each of the coffins
and place them on the truck. But they leave the sixth coffin where it
lies as the truck pulls away.

Main Timeline September 1988
============================

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob's
remains, could not be buried with the others because he was a foreigner.
Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash
site, wholly accident, some five years previously. He wrote his contacts
in the air force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site
investigation, but received only vague, non-committal replies -- or only
silence. Muharto's expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying,
wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of
RI-002 than they are telling. Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth
coffin, presumably containing Bob's remains, could not be buried with
the others as a foreigner cannot be interred in a cemetery for national
heroes, however much he may deserve the honor himself through his
services to the nation.

Muharto's expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces Cameron
that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking closure
about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto wonders that if he had
turned down promotion and had been with Bob on the final flight, maybe
it would not have ended in tragedy.
