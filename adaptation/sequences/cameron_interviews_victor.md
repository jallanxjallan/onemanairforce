Julia and Cameron enter the IPPHOS office, located on the ground floor
of a building in the old section of Jakarta and one inspection away from
being condemned. An ancient air conditioner wheezes over a window,
barely reducing the heat and humidity. Victor, a slight, elderly man of
sallow complexion, is the only person in the office and is openly delighted
at receiving company. Julia introduces Cameron and explains the purpose
of their visit. The negatives and prints are held in tattered folders
placed on shelves seemingly at random, but Victor strides confidently to
a shelf, pulls out a folder from the middle of a pile, and brings it
back to the desk. He leafs through the folder and pulls out a strip of
negatives showing a large American standing in front of an airplane. It
is Bob Freeberg and RI-002. Victor repeats the process and shows Cameron
images of Spoor in his office. Victor explains that he was a recruit posted to KNIL headquarters as an photographer analyst. His desk was close to Spoor's office, and remembers overhearing Spoor raging that the Thai authorities had released
Freeberg. 

On 20 October 1947 at his desk outside Spoor's office at KNIL
headquarters, Victor overhears Spoor raging that the Thai authorities had released
Freeberg.

At IPPHOS, Victor searches for more shots of Batavia to prod his memory about
Spoor's efforts to stop the blockade runs. He stops when he comes across
a photo of a strikingly beautiful Indonesian woman who, though dressed in baggy, paint-splattered overalls radiates elegance
and poise. The caption reads
"Emeria Soenassa in her studio 1948". Julia asks Victor who she is.
Victor replies "No one important", snatches the photo from the table and
files it away.
