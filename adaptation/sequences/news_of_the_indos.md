Cameron receives a message at the Jakarta Post from Julia suggesting he visit the
library again the following day. He does so, and Julia introduces him to
Victor, an older man, disheveled but still dignified, a retired journalist. Victor tells Cameron of his experiences reporting on the activities of the colonial government for his newspaper, the *Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad*, the leading newspaper of the Dutch East Indies and the voice of the *Indos*, people of European or mixed heritage who had lived in the archipelago for many generations. He relates humorous anecdotes of the frustration of colonial authorities with foreign blockade runners like Bob Freeberg, who they regarded as common criminals. In Bob's case, no one was surprised at the news that RI-002 had vanished with a small fortune in gold.
