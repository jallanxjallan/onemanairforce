Eddy opposes Julia marrying a foreigner. Eddy has checked into Cameron's
background, and found he is penniless and with a spotty academic record,
though he excelled in journalism and seems to be a good writer. Eddy
promises to fulfill her dream of studying overseas. Julia says you don't
have the money. Eddy replies that he is making arrangements. Julia says
ok, as long as one of the arrangements is not marriage.

The following evening, Julia is sitting in a restaurant with Eric, a well-groomed, obviously
affluent young man. Eric mentions his surprise Julia's mother phoned his
mother to suggest he take her to dinner. Eric dominates the
conversation, relating, in grandiose style, how he is an essential
component in the business deal that their respective father's are
cooking up. Julia wants more details about this "business deal", but
decides it would be better to remain silent. Julia picks at her dinner
and nods politely.
