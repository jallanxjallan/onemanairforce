**The following day**, Cameron returns to the library to enlist Julia's assistance in
investigating the mystery by researching library archives. Julia is
eager to help, and disappears into the stacks, emerging with bound
volumes of Dutch-language newspapers. She reads aloud, in English, some news
articles printed in the days after the disappearance.

**In a flashback to October 1948**, a reporter from the Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad newspaper accosts General
Spoor in the hallway and badgers him for information of the fate of
RI-002. Spoor claims ignorance, and grows visibly annoyed when the
reporter press him, breaking off the interview and slamming the door to
his office.

**In the present day** Julia notes that the snide tone of the language in the article suggests the reporter was
convinced that Spoor was hiding something. She says they might get more
information from Victor de Jong, a Dutch-born, naturalized Indonesian
photographer who consults for the museum. Victor had told Julia that he had been a Dutch
conscript assigned to KNIL headquarters as an assistant photographic technician/analyst reporting directly to Spoor.
