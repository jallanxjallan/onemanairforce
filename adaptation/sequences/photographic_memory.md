[Photographic Memory]{cat="scene"}[7 July 1988]{cat="date"}  Julia and Cameron enter the IPPHOS office, located
on the ground floor of a ramshackle building in the colonial-era section of
Jakarta. An ancient air conditioner wheezes over a window, having no
discernible effect on the heat and humidity. The office has a single
occupant: Victor, a slight, elderly man of sallow complexion, who is the
only person in the office and openly delighted at receiving company.

Julia introduces Cameron and explains the purpose of their visit. The
negatives and prints of the collection are stored in tattered folders
placed seemingly at random, but Victor strides confidently to a shelf,
pulls out a folder from the middle of a pile, and brings it back to the
desk. He leafs through the folder and pulls out a strip of negatives
showing a large American standing in front of an airplane. It is Bob
Freeberg and RI-002. Victor repeats the process and shows Cameron images
of Spoor in his office. 

Victor explains that in [1947]{cat="date"} his desk was across the hall from Spoor's office, and would often overhear conversations or Spoor raging about the foreign pilots violating Dutch East Indies airspace with impunity. He was particularly incensed at the report of Freeberg dropping paratroopers over Dutch-held territory in Kalimantan. Spoor instructed Dutch representatives in the region to pressure authorities to impound RI-002. In all cases, they would detain Freeberg briefly, then release him. 

[At IPPHOS]{cat="location"}, Victor searches the hundreds of thousands of images in the archives, looking for more photos that will spark his memory of the time. He stops when he comes across
a photo of a strikingly beautiful Indonesian woman in her late twenties who, though dressed
in baggy, paint-splattered overalls, radiates elegance and poise. The
caption reads "Emeria Soenassa in her studio 1948". Julia asks Victor
who she is. Victor replies "No one important", snatches the photo from
the table and files it away.
