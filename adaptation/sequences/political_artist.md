[SLUGLINE]{name="Political Artist" date="21 July 1988"} Julia visits
Hendra, who is languishing in poverty because of his past associations with the communist party. He is initally wary of this strange young woman showing up at this door, but Julia disarms him, and he tells of a frightening incident at Emeria's Salon.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Hiding Hendra" date="10 October 1947"} A squad of native KNIL soldiers burst into Emeria's studio. Emeria is composed and polite, inviting them to search the studio. However, she refuses to allow them to enter her private bedroom, as it would be "improper". The squad commander, a Javanese, is intimidated. He thanks Emeria for her cooperation, and they leave. Moments afterward, Hendra emerges from the bedroom.
