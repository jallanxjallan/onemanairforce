[Birth of RI-002]{cat="scene"}[28 June 1988]{cat="date"}  Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting
with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when
they hear the roar of a large motorcycle. Muharto, in jest,
covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in
front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. His wife Ani
opens it to find Cameron Bishop, an engaging, disheveled young American freelance journalist, who says has an appointment to interview Muharto about his experiences with Bob Freeberg. Muharto recovers from his astonishment that a "Hell's Angel" has come to interview him, and begins by telling Cameron of a message he received one morning at his desk in Maguwo air base in Jogjakarta.

[Surprise message]{cat="scene"}[08 June 1947]{cat="date"}  In Jogja, Muharto's commander, Suryadarma, contracts Freeberg to fly a load of high-value quinine and vanilla to Manila, returning with much-needed vehicle parts and medicines. As the war-surplus Dakota has not yet been registered, Muharto suggests they paint the numbers RI-002 on the tail to forestall problems with aviation authorities. 

Freeberg flies RI-002 to Manila with Muharto, Army Lieutenant Pang Soeparto, and Budiardjo, a radio operator. Freeberg and his "Javanese Crew" become media celebrities, but are stranded in Manila for months, fighting Dutch representations for the right to sell the cargo. Freeberg is also in court, attempting to reach an agreement with Bob Walters, his former partner, over ownership of RI-002. 

Muharto and Pang finally win their case, sell the quinine, and RI-002 returns to Jogja. For the next six months, Freeberg, often with Muharto in the co-pilot seat, links the besieged Republic of Indonesia with the rest of the world. Freeberg is hailed as a hero, gaining the respect of everyone from common citizens to President Soekarno himself. 

By April 1948, Freeberg's haggard appearance and premature greying reflects the constant strain of being the Republic's "One Man Air Force". In May 1948 Muharto is offered a promotion to major and reassignment to a desk job. Worried about his friend, Muharto considers declining the promotion. However, he is now engaged to his girlfiend Ani, and must think about their future. 

Busy with his own duties, Muharto sees little of Freeberg until 30 September 1948, when he visited his friend as he was readyng RI-002 to ferry Republican gold to safety in Sumatra ahead of a feared invasion of Jogja. Freeberg had seemed tired and distracted, nothing like the cheerful, competent pilot of the previous year. RI-002 was reported missing on the following day. 

Muharto ends the September 1988 interview by telling Cameron that the wreckage of RI-002 was discovered a decade previously on a remote mountain in Sumatra. He shows Cameron clippings from April 1977 reporting that no gold was found, only a few skeletal fragments. A photograph dated 29 July 1977 in the Air Force magazine shows the five coffins containing the remains of the Indonesian crew being loaded onto a truck, while a sixth coffin, larger that the others, remains behind. 

Muharto tells Cameron that none of the remains were ever identified. Muharto wonders if he had elected to continue flying with Freeberg, the tragedy might have been averted.
