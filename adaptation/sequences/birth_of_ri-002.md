In Manila, Dutch representatives take Muharto and Pang to court, claiming the quinine as Dutch property. After a dramatic court appearance, Muharto wins the case, and RI-002 returns to Jogja in September. 

For the next year, Bob Freeberg and RI-002 provide an essential link between Jogja and the region, flying out valuable agriculture goods to be traded for medicine, vehicle and radio spart parts, and other essentials. The people of Jogja consider Freeberg a hero, to the point of embarrassing him by serving him special food like canned corned beef while everyone else subsists on rice and soy cake.  

By [SLUGLINE]{name="Grey Hairs" date="April 1948"}, Muharto worries that the constant stress is taking a toll on Freeberg, who is showing grey hairs at age 27. The following month, Muharto is promoted to major and given a desk job. Muharto last meets Freeberg on [SLUGLINE]{name="Last Meeting" date="30 September 1948"}  as he prepares to fly a ton of Republican gold to Sumatra in advance of a feared Dutch invasion. The following day, RI-002 was reported as missing. 

[SLUGLINE]{name="Initial Searches" date="28 June 1988"} Muharto tells that neither the Dutch nor the Republic were able to any trace of the missing Dakota. Wreckage was found in April 1977, but none of the gold was found.
