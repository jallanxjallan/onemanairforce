When the library closes, Cameron and Julia discover that they each have arrangements to meet friends at the nearby Hotel Borobudur, a popular social venue for affluent Indonesians and resident foreigners. Cameron
offers Julia a ride. She accepts, and is nonplussed when, in the parking lot, he jumps on a vintage Harley Davidson motorcycle and tells her to hop on the back seat. As they
pull out of the parking lot onto the street, Cameron opens the throttle
and powerful bike roars and leaps forward in response. In mild panic, Julia grabs
Cameron’s waist, to her embarrassment.

Cameron pulls up at the hotel entrance, impressing Julia’s friends, who
are waiting for her by the door. Cameron drives away to park his Harley,
while Julia and her friends go to their event, a birthday party for
another general's daughter where the gifts include a house and a car.
The friends press Julia for information about Cameron, and suggest that
since he rides a huge motorcycle, and is a *bule*, he must be rich, teasing her that since her father, unlike other generals, does not give his daughter unlimited amounts of money, she needs a rich boyfriend.
