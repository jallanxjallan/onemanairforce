Cameron attend the 40th wedding anniversary of Ani and Petit Muharto. During the event, Ani regales guests with her recollections of her wedding and the weeks that followed. 

[SLUGLINE]{name="Muharto Marries Ani" date="24 October 1948"} Ani and
Muharto marry. The day is marked by equal measures of joy and sadness,
as the absence of Bob Freeberg weighs heavy on Muharto's heart.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Ani Berates Westerling" date="27 December 1948"} The Dutch invade and occupy Jogja. A
Dutch patrol stops Muharto and Ani as they hurry home. The soldiers
point to Muharto's khaki shorts and accuse him of being in the military.
Ani summons all the imperious passion of a high-born Javanese women to
give the commanding officer a vicious tongue lashing, diverting
attention while Muharto swallows his Air Force identification.
