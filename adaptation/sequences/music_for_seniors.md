title: Music For Seniors

[Music For Seniors]{cat="scene"}[15 August 1988]{cat="date"}  One evening at the Earthquake, the music is supplied by a band playing *keroncong*, a
guitar-driven genre that features sentimental Dutch-language lyrics.
Regarded as "music for old folks" the audience of senior and retired
military officers laps it up. Afterward, Sanyoto introduces Syd and
Cameron to Samuel Quiko, the band leader. Sanyoto mentions that Samuel
had been active in the revolution, and might have interesting stories to
tell.
[Irrelevant Musician]{cat="scene"}[16 August 1988]{cat="date"} [At the library]{cat="location"} Cameron
mentions his meeting with Samuel Quiko to Julia. She remarks on distinctive
name, indicating a Portuguese heritage, and remembers seeing it in a
review of a musical performance in 1947. She disappears into the stacks,
reappearing with an armful of magazines containing articles about
keroncong. Julia sees that in several of the photos Samuel is with
Emeria. Julia suggests that they interview Samuel Quiko. Cameron demurs,
saying that a guy who plays "music for seniors" would be of little value
in investigating the fate of RI-002. Julia shoots Cameron a contemptuous glance, and peruses the articles for a listing of Samuel's contact information. 

[Visit to Kampung Tugu]{cat="scene"}[18 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Julia goes alone to Kampung Tugu, a village on the
outskirts of Jakarta that is the home of keroncong, to interview Samuel
Quiko. Samuel tells of the peril his people faced after the war, being
regarded as "Brown Dutchmen".

[Bersiap]{cat="scene"}[04 October 1945]{cat="date"}  Youth gangs armed with deadly bamboo spears roam the
streets, threatening Europeans and any Indonesians deemed to be allied
with the Dutch. Samuel leads his neighbors in setting up nightly patrols
of Kampung Tugu and barricading entrances to the village.

[Proof of Patriotism]{cat="scene"}[18 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Samuel tells Julia that during the Bersiap period he sought the
protection of the local preman. To prove his loyalty to the Republic, he
offered to use his unique position of being able to access both colonial
and Republican worlds to act as a courier -- or even a spy. 

[Krokodil Kourier]{cat="scene"}[04 September 1947]{cat="date"}  Samuel and his band play at an exhibition at the Kuntskring. In between sets, Samuel chats with Auke Sonnega, who surreptitiously hands him a small package. Walking back to their lodgings after the event they are stopped by a Dutch patrol. Samuel tells them
they are musicians returning from a society gathering, and as proof they
take out their guitars and break into a Dutch-language Stamboel song.
The soldiers grin and let him pass.

They continue walking to the house in a "native" neighborhood where they
will spend the night. Samuel gives the package to a preman who will smuggle it across the demarcation line to Jogja.
