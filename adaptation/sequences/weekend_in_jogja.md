[Weekend In Jogja]{cat="scene"}[1 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Muharto and Cameron travel to Jogjakarta: Muharto on the train and Cameron on his Harley. Cameron arrives first, and visits the Affandi Musuem. 
[Old Maestro]{cat="scene"}[1 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Cameron roars up the driveway of the Affandi Museum, in the process startling a
disheveled elderly man, is sitting on a bench on the grounds
of the compound, more resembling a homeless person seeking rest than the owner of this sprawling estate containing a fortune in paintings and sculptures. Affandi openly admires the motorcycle, and smiles in greeting as Cameron introduces himself. Affandi becomes effusive
when Cameron tells him he brings greetings from Boedi. They fall into animated
conversation. Cameron explains the purpose of his visit, and Affandi
launches into a humorous and poignant narrative of painting propaganda
posters amid the privation and danger of besieged Jogjakarta. 
[Propaganda Paintings]{cat="scene"}[4 August 1947]{cat="date"}  After repeated attempts, Hendra finally convinces Affandi to join them to make propaganda paintings. They travel to the demarcation line south of Semarang. They crouch in the vegetation a hundred meters from a Dutch outputs. At first, Affandi cowers, unwilling to raise his head enough to see the output. Then, he leaps up, saying "If I die, I die!" and sketches furiously. The soldiers spot him, turn their binoculars for a closer look, then burst into laughter. 

When the Dutch invade, Pelukis Rakyat members bury the propaganda paintings in the forest. They return six months later only to discover that in the meantime
villagers had dug them up to make clothing, tired of being dressed in old rice sacks since the Japanese occupation.
[Captured Spy]{cat="scene"}[15 October 1988]{cat="date"}  Cameron notices a realistic portrait of a young man crouched against a wall in a posture of defeat. Affandi explains he had been a teenager accused of spying for the Dutch and summarily executed moments after he had finished the sketch for the painting. 


[Gift for a Friend]{cat="scene"}[1 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Affandi grabs
a sketch pad, dashes off a self-portrait, signs it, and hands it
Cameron, explaining that it is a gift for Boedi to thank him for
sending him a new friend.


[Hike up Merapi]{cat="scene"}[2 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Cameron accompanies Muharto to a village on the
upper slopes of the Merapi volcano to meet Muharto's spiritual advisor,
Mbah Maridjan. The three hike the steep incline to a shrine;
effortlessly in the case of the sexagenarian duo of Muharto and
Maridjan; with some difficulty by their companion, some four decades
their junior. Cameron watches respectfully as the two intone Islamic
prayers, then lay Hindu-style floral offerings at the shrine to the gods
of the mountain.
[Aviation Museum Tour]{cat="scene"}[2 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Muharto takes Cameron to the Air Force museum, a re-purposed hanger filled with decommissioned aircraft and other exhibits. Muharto points to a model of the Zogling training glider, and tells Cameron of  the time he pulled rank and flew the Zogling himself.


[Flying The Zogling]{cat="scene"}[04 September 1946]{cat="date"}  Muharto pulls rank and commandeers the Zogling
training glider pulled by a Harley Davidson engine. When he lands,
Suryadarma is waiting, and angrily orders him back to his desk.

[Mysterious Bullet]{cat="scene"}[2 August 1988]{cat="date"}  Muharto seeks out the curator, who invites them into his
office. Muharto asks the curator to retrieve scraps from the RI-002
wreckage stored at the museum. One of the items is the dynamo with the
bullet inexplicably lodged in the windings. Muharto picks it up, and
from his point of view, the room around him fades into mist.

Muharto is astounded to realize he is somehow in the radio nook of
RI-002 on the day of the crash. The airplane shutters as the engines
scream in protest. Muharto sees two shadowy figures in the pilot seats,
and a forested mountainside fills the window.

The museum office comes back into focus, and Muharto sees the concerned
faces of Cameron and the curator. Muharto places the dynamo back into
the storage box and says, in a wavering voice, that he will miss his
train back to Jakarta if he doesn't hurry.
