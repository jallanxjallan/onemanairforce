In the Jakarta Post newsroom, Cameron finishes the first draft of the Muharto interview, then hands it to Syd Jardine, a disheveled, chain-smoking, older American sitting at the adjacent desk. After reading it, Syd tells Cameron that the article is good, but a bit thin, and needs more context to be understandable to the Post's foreign readership. Syd suggests Cameron go to the national library and read the book *Recruit to Revolution*, which has a chapter on Freeberg, and all the historical background Cameron needs. 

The following morning Cameron visits the National Library. Using his Jakarta Post credentials, he is admitted to the limited-access
reference section, an archive of publications and books dating back to
colonial times. He is greeted, in fluent English, by Julia, an
attractive, bookish Indonesian woman in her early twenties. Julia finds
the sole copy of *Recruit to Revolution*, which, like all items in the
collection, cannot be taken from the premises. Cameron settles down to
read the book and take copious notes of the historical background of the
struggle as seen through the eyes of the author.

After taking his notes, Cameron asks Julia where he can get
some coffee. Julia says that no liquids are allowed the reading room, but since she was planning to take a break herself, she invites Cameron to join her in the
canteen. Over coffee, Cameron tells Julia that he loves living in
Indonesia, but is often annoyed when asked about his family or marital
status, matters that Americans consider too personal to share with total
strangers. Julia says that Indonesians consider these questions to be
polite. So Cameron, plainly in jest, ask Julia a rapid-fire series of
personal questions, which she answers in good humor. Cameron discovers that Julia is an only child, she has an
aristocratic heritage, and she got her job through her fluency in Dutch
and English. Cameron says it is your turn, but Julia just smiles and
said she will ask her Dad. At Cameron’s quizzical look, Julia 
explains that her father is a senior officer in the Army’s Intel section
and he can tell her anything she wants to know about Cameron’s
background. Though Julia is obviously teasing him in return, Cameron
gulps down his coffee and says he should get back to work.
