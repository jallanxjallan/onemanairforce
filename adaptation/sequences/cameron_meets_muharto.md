title: Cameron Meets Muharto
---

In September 1988, Sabam Siagian, managing editor of the Jakarta Post, assigns Cameron, a
young American recently hired as a copy editor, to interview his friend
Petit Muharto about his experiences running the Dutch blockade with American pilot Bob
Freeberg.

Cameron meets Muharto, a dapper, energetic Indonesian man in his
late sixties, at his tidy residence in a Jakarta suburb. Muharto recounts his exploits in RI-002 in such vivid detail that Cameron can clearly visualize the events Muharto is describing starting with a surprise telephone call he received at Maguwo Airbase in Jogjakarta on June 1947, reporting that a foreign pilot has landed on a remote beach nearby and asked for Muharto by name. 

Muharto reports the surprising call to Suryadarma, the commander of the
Air Force. Suryadarma grins, saying: "Must be one of your foreign flyboy
friends", and sends Muharto to Tasik to investigate.

Flying to Tasik in a refurbished Japanese aircraft, whose pilot had only
first seen an airplane a few months previously, Muharto takes his mind
from possible catastrophe by recollecting his experiences during his
blockade runs three months previously, wondering which pilot it might
be.

On the third blockade run, with Bob Freeberg as captain, the overcast
sky forces Muharto to navigate by asking Bob to fly low enough to follow
the railway line to Jogja.

In Jogja, Muharto introduces Bob to Suryadarma, who thanks the American
for his assistance, and asks him to perform some risky tasks on the
return leg. Bob grins and readily agrees.

Muharto asks Bob to make a test landing on a refurbished wartime
airstrip designed for smaller aircraft such as fighters. Bob happily
complies, and sets the Dakota down with only a few meters to spare on
the runway. Muharto introduces Bob to Santoso, the base commander.

Bob uses his wartime aviation skills to parachute Air Force engineers
and their gear to a bull's eye landing on a pot-holed highland airstrip
they are tasked to refurbish.

The Nikosoren lands in Tasik. Muharto is met by Pang, and army
lieutenant who had called him, and reveals that his commander thought
Freeberg was a spy and wanted to shoot him. They load up a jeep with two
barrels of aviation fuel and drive to the beach.

Muharto and Pang arrive at Cikolong beach. As soon as Muharto sees the
beach, bookended by two rivers and the gap between the water and palm
trees scarcely more than the Dakota's wing span, he knew that, of all
the pilots he had met, only Bob Freeberg had the skill to make that
landing.

Bob tells Muharto that his Dakota is stuck in the soft sand. Muharto
rallies the hundreds of villagers who have gathered for the spectacle of
the foreigner and his giant aircraft to tear apart their houses and use
the woven bamboo walls as a makeshift runway. The Dakota takes off with
Muharto on board and heads to Jogja.

In Jogja, Suradarma commissions Bob to fly a cargo valuable quinine to
Manila and return with medicine and other goods. To forestall possible
problems with authorities in Manila Muharto suggests that they paint a
registration number, RI-002, on the unregistered war-surplus Dakota.
In Jogja, Suryadarma commissions Freeberg to fly quinine to Manila. 

Over breakfast at Tom Lee's house, Tom reads the newspaper headlines
about "Fearless Bob Freeberg" and his "Javanese Crew". One article
reports that the Dutch are laying claim to the valuable quinine cargo as
the "Javanese Crew" are "subjects of the Dutch Queen".

Bob and Muharto attend their first court session to decide who owns
Dutch representatives take them to court over possession of the quinine
cargo.

Muharto and Boedi listen in horror to shortwave radio reports that a blockade runner has been shot down on
approach to Maguwo. 

As they wait for a buyer for the quinine Muharto, Boedi, and Pang eat one meal a day at a Indian restaurant. On most days Bob joins them and pays for all, because he is responsible for their well-being until he returns them to Java.

Muharto takes Bob to meet Soekarno . At the presidential palace. As was
his custom in private conversation, Soekarno treats Bob as an equal and
urges him to stay and help the struggle.

Bob stations himself at the Hotel Merdeka in Jogja taking RI-002 on both military and civilian missions in support of the Republic.

Bob, Muharto, and Boedi prepare to fly delegates to Manila. 

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew with RI-002 until May 1948, when he was promoted to Major and assigned to a desk at headquarters. He saw little of Bob after that, but was looking forward to having Bob as guest of honor at his wedding in October. But three weeks before the wedding he was devasted to learn that RI-002 had vanished on a mission.  

Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash
site, wholly by accident, some five years previously. He wrote to his contacts
in the Air Force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site
investigation, but received vague, non-committal replies --- or only
silence. 

An Air Force team investigating the crash site find a few human remains, confirmation that it was RI-002, but no sign of the gold cargo. 

In an otherwise empty hanger, five coffins draped in Indonesian flags
lay on a platform. A sixth coffin, larger than the rest and without a
flag, rests on a separate platform. A flatbed truck pulls in to the
hanger and a a squad of airmen, all silent and respectful pick up each
of the coffins and place them on the truck. But they leave the sixth
coffin where it lies as the truck pulls away.

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob’s
remains, could not be buried with the others as a foreigner cannot be interred in a cemetery for national heroes, however much he may deserve the honor himself through his services to the nation.

Muharto’s expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying,
wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of
RI-002 than they are telling.
