Muharto takes Cameron to a long-overdue reunion with Boediardjo, the
radio operator of RI-002. The two old comrades revel in recounting their
experiences on RI-002, including the time Bob dove into a tropical storm
to evade a Dutch patrol.

On 17 October 1947, Bob and Boedi fly ten paratroopers to be dropped near an insurgent
stronghold in the forests of Kalimantan. None have jumped before, or
even been in a aircraft, so tension is high. There is an uproar as the
parachute of one trooper opens and dumps onto the cabin floor. The
trooper swears it was an accident, but all others accuse him of
cowardice. The troopers look at each other, wondering if any one will be
next. Boedi enters the cabin. Though he is only an airman, the
charismatic Boedi takes command of the situation, assuring the troopers
that Bob has much wartime experience flying paratroopers and will drop
them safely. He goes to the cockpit and talks with Bob for a moment. The
Bob turns the aircraft over to his co pilot, leaves his seat and stands
in the doorway, his body filling the frame. With Boedi translating, Bob
assures the troops that he has done this many times during the war, and
will drop them exactly on the requested target. Emboldened by Bobs air
of quiet competence, each trooper moves forward and shakes Bobs hand.
Bob returns to his seat, the dropmaster issues the command to jump, and
the cabin empties, save for the dropmaster and a lone recruit wondering
what fate is in store for him back at Maguwo. Boedi watches as the
parachutes drift down and land are enveloped by the endless forest.
Boedi asks Bob how many paradrops he made. Bob grins and answers: "None.
I was a Navy pilot. All my missions were over water."

A few days later, Bob flies two Indonesian aviators, Halim and Iswandi, to Bangkok where they will 
purchase a twin-prop airplane that will become RI-003. Dutch authorities
pressure the Thai government to detain Freeberg as a blockade runner.
The Thais briefly detain Freeberg in a comfortable hotel room, but the
Indonesian crew must find their own accommodation. They can only afford
rooms in a bar district. Boedi is delighted, but Halim and Iswandi are
appalled. Both are engaged to be married, and worry that the families of
their respective fianc√©es will learn that they have stayed in such a
disreputable environment.
