Bob refuses Soekarno's order to land on unsafe airfield

Standing on the wing speaking to an assembled crowd, Soekarno points to
Bob in the cockpit, proclaiming: "This is Bob Freeberg, a friend of all
Indonesians"

Suryadarma orders Bob to Sumatra on another mission. Bob refuses, and
infuriates Suryadarma by returning to Manila that day.
