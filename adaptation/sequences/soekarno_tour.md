The starboard landing gear collapses just as RI-002 is about to take
off. Nevertheless, Bob and the airstrip crew right the craft,
repressurize the hydraulics, and take off as Dave Fowler shakes his head
in dismay.

Bob flies low over a town where an important regional leader lives to
determine whether he can land RI-002 safely on an overgrown grass
airstrip. Bob decides not to risk the safety of his passengers, which
infuriates Soekarno. He demands that Bob land on the strip, declaring:
"I'm the president!" Bob replies, pointing downward: "Down there, sir,
indeed you are the president. But up here, I'm the captain."

The Soekarno Tour props up support for the independence struggle and to
raise money to purchase a presidential aircraft, to be named RI-001.
During one speech, delivered on the airfield where RI-002 had landed.
Soekarno points to Bob resting in the shade with Boedi under a wing and
says: "Here is a foreigner, but unlike the Dutch, he is our friend."
