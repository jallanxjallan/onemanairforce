[SLUGLINE]{name="Cameron offers a ride" date="7 July 1988"} Julia tells
Cameron that she is meeting friends, all daughters of generals or high
officials, for coffee at the Mandarin Hotel. That hotel is also the
watering hole for the foreign press, so Cameron offers to give her a
lift and then meet his colleagues for a beer.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Julia and her friends" date="7 July 1988"} Julia's
friends urge her to get closer to Cameron, noting that her father, who
unlike theirs, is only mildly corrupt and cannot afford to send Julia to
graduate school in America.
