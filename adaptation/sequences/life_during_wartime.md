Julia have dinner with Muharto and Ani. Afterward, Cameron and Muharto
fall deep into discussion about the revelations of their investigations.

rabbit hole, but keep their views to themselves. Instead Ani tells Julia
stories about when her husband was a dashing young officer, and of the
hardships of life in besieged Jogja.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Ani Serves Rice" date="15 July 1948"} Ani helps to run
a communal kitchen to feed the thousands of refugees pouring into
Jogjakarta.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Father Interrogates" date="07 April 1948"} Ani's father
questions Muharto about his career path. He notes that as nominal
