Cameron writes up the interview, and gives it to managing editor Sabam
Siagian, who had given him the assignment. Sabam glances at the copy,
grunts, then passes the pages to Syd Jardine, the senior copy editor.
Syd reads it carefully, then remarks that Freeberg comes off as a
"super-pilot" and not believable. He suggests Cameron find other
accounts of Bob by researching in the reference section of the newly
opened National Library.

The following day, Cameron uses his Jakarta Post credentials to gain access to the
reference section of the National Library. Julia Suryakusuma, an attractive, bookish woman in
her early 20s, is the only staffer speaking fluent English, and so is
assigned to assist him, as visitors are now allowing into the stacks. Cameron explains his mission, and Julia disappears into the stacks,
returning shortly with a few books written by foreigners about the
period. Skimming through the material, Cameron's attention is drawn to a
passage in a book by British diplomat John Coast relating events at a
gathering of foreign aviators in the mountain town of Bukittinggi, a
Republican base of operations.

On the evening of 8 March 1948 in the ballroom of the former Dutch
governor's palace in Bukittinggi, Richard Cobley, a semi-piratical
British aviator, drunkenly accuses Bob of taking the best blockade-running contracts through his close relationship with the Indonesian government. Later, while Bob stumbles
along an unlit path to his lodgings, Cobley confronts him, warning that
an "accident" might happen to his ramshackle Dakota unless he shares the
wealth.

In the library, Cameron closes the book, looks at the materials remaining in his stack, and tells Julia he wants to get some coffee. Julia tells him that beverages are not allowed in the reading room, but she would be happy to escort him to the libary canteen. Over coffee,
Julia tells Cameron of her dream of securing a scholarship to pursue
post-graduate studies in America. Cameron attempts, in turn, to tell of
his dreams of becoming an international investigative journalist. But
Julia stops him, saying, with a mischievious smile, that if she wants to
know anything about him she will simply ask her father, who is a senior
officer in military intelligence. Cameron puts down his coffee, looks
around involuntarily, then tells Julia he should
be getting back to the Jakarta Post.
