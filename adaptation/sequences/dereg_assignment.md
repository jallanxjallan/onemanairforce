Sabam asks Cameron to prepare a series of articles about the coming
capital market deregulation which will be run, without a byline, as
background. He will be allowed to use JP credentials interview
foreigners only for these articles.

Cameron tells Syd of his assignment, and, in a sardonic voice, asks if
he can write articles that are “boring” enough to be financial
reporting. Syd lights a cigarette, takes his flask of whiskey from the
desk drawer, pours a splash into his coffee, and then into the coffee
cup on Cameron’s desk, and says: “This whole deregulation thing will be
anything but boring. Let me tell you about what’s really happening with
the stock market.”
