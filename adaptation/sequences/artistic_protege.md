[Artistic Protege]{cat="scene"}[1 September 1988]{cat="date"}  Julia reads a review of an exhibition conducted in Jakarta some years before
by an amateur watercolorist named Regina Artista Maya, who credits Emeria as a major influence. Julia contacts the exhibition venue, acquires Regina's contact information, and arranges a meeting. 

[Life in the Salon]{cat="scene"}[5 September 1988]{cat="date"}  Regina tells Julia that she was from a village in the ancestral region of Emeria's family. When she turned 16 she was sent to Batavia to work in Emeria's household in exchange for school. She remembers her mistress as highly intelligent with a forceful personality. 

[Artistic Inspiration]{cat="scene"}[5 September 1988]{cat="date"}  Regina tells Julia that Emeria inspired her to practice art. A frequent guest, a youthful Dutch man, tutored her on sketching. Regina does not remember his name, but suspects he may have been a soldier, since he would always leave early in the evening, even when food and drink was flowing freely.
