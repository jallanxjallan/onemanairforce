[SLUGLINE]{name="Julia Meets Regina" date="1 September 1988"} Julia
reads a review of an exhibition in Jakarta some years before
by an artist named Regina Artista Maya. In the review, Regina credits
Emeria as a major influence. Julia contacts the exhibition venue,
acquires Regina's contact information, and arranges a meeting.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Julia interviews Regina" date="5 September 1988"}
Regina tells Julia that her family had worked for Emeria's family for generations, and so when she turned 16 she was sent to Batavia as a household servant.

 

[SLUGLINE]{name="Artistic Inspiration" date="5 September 1988"} Regina
tells Julia that Emeria inspired her to practice art. A frequent guest,
a youthful Dutch man, tutored her on sketching. Regina does not remember
his name, but suspects he may have been a soldier, since he would always
leave early in the evening, even when food and drink was flowing freely.
