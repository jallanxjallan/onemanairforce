[Documenting Westerling]{cat="scene"}[27 December 1948]{cat="date"}  Spoor sends Victor to Jogja with the invading
troops to prove photograph what he expects to be a warm welcome as
liberators. The reception is anything but that. Victor is part of the
squadron that accosts Muharto and Ani in the market, and witnesses Ani
berating the squad commander.

[Going AWOL]{cat="scene"}[28 December 1948]{cat="date"}  Jogjakarta is declared  secure, and Victor
can walk around Jogja alone to document the condition of the town. A man
he recognizes as a friend of Emeria approaches him in a quiet alley to
say that if he wants to defect, Emeria is with Sudirman's forces in the
hinterland. Victor says he will bring his camera so the world can
witness the strength and courage of the Indonesians. The man nods in
agreement, then admonishes Victor to not forget his gun and as much
ammunition as he can carry.

[Fraternization Warning]{cat="scene"}[07 December 1948]{cat="date"}  Spoor warns Victor about fraternizing with
Emeria and the Republican artists. Spoor threatens to reassign Victor to
a combat unit.
