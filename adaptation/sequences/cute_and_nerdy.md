[Cute and Nerdy]{cat="scene"}[30 June 1988]{cat="date"}  Cameron uses his "foreign correspondent" credentials to gain access to the reference section of the National Library. Julia Suryakusuma, an attractive, bookish woman in her early 20s, the only staffer speaking fluent English, is assigned to assist him. Cameron explains his mission, and Julia disappears into the stacks, returning shortly with some books written by foreigners about the period. 

One account of an incident in [January 1948]{cat="date"} in a Singapore bar shows how most aviators considered Freeberg the most skilled and courageous of their brotherhood, but were envious of how he seemed to monopolize contracts with the Republic. 

[Back in the Library]{cat="location"}, Cameron is tired. Julia invites him to join her for coffee in the canteen. Julia, tells of her dream of taking her post-graduate studies in America, then casually mentions that her father is a military intelligence officer.
