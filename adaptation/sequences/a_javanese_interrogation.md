---
[A Javanese Interrogation]{cat="scene"}[20 July 1988]{cat="date"}  Cameron is having a drink at the
Earthquake, chatting with Sanyoto, when a middle-aged Indonesian, clearly a military man though out of uniform, takes the empty seat beside him. Sanyoto introduces him as "Pak Eddy"
and leaves them to chat. Eddy is affable, and asks Cameron
general questions about how he likes Indonesia and other inoccuous questions generally asked of foreigners. But the conversation shifts to pointed inquiries about Cameron's
education and life goals. After Eddy leaves, Cameron remarks to Sanyoto
that he feels like he has just been interrogated. .

[An Unsuitable Boy]{cat="scene"}[9 July 1988]{cat="date"}  The next morning, Eddy is revealed to be Julia's father. He lectures his daughter about getting into a relationship with an "unsuitable boy", though not mentioning Cameron directly. He does state that since Julia is his only child, he will do anything for her, including sending her off to school in a foreign land, it that is what she truly wishes. Julia reminds him that
his nickname is "Honest Eddy" and that his only income is his military
wage. Eddy replies that he is making arrangements. Julia is doubtful,
but agrees to go along with whatever he plans, as long as it is not an
arranged marriage to some rich brat.

[Arranged Date]{cat="scene"}[22 July 1988]{cat="date"}  Julia sits in a restaurant
with Eric, a young Indonesian man of good family. Eric mentions his
surprise when Julia's mother phoned his mother to suggest he take her to
dinner. Eric dominates the conversation, insisting, with the
authoritative confidence typical of the offspring of new wealth, how he
is an essential component in the business deal that their respective
fathers are cooking up. Julia wants more details about this "business
deal", but decides it would be better to remain silent.
