[SLUGLINE]{name="Julia Reads About Robert Koke" date="5 October 1988"}
Julia finds a book written by Robert Koke's wife about their experiences
operating a hotel in Bali before the war. The depiction of Koke as being
sympathetic to Indonesians and critical of the Dutch contradicts the
image of a CIA coup-monger.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Master of Dissemination" date="6 October 1988"} Cameron
dismisses Julia's contention that Robert Koke supported independence,
saying it is only typical CIA dissemination. Annoyed at being brushed
off, Julia sends a letter to Koke through the book's publisher,
expressing her interest about his time in Batavia.
