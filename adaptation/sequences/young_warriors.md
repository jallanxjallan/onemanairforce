[Young Warriors]{cat="scene"}[21 July 1988]{cat="date"}  Sanyoto introduces Cameron to George Rueneker, a retired Air Force officer
who owns an aviation-services company. George is of mixed
European-Indonesian heritage and, like many of his fellow "Indos"
decided to support the Indonesian struggle for freedom.

[Kids With Guns]{cat="scene"}[07 October 1947]{cat="date"}  Muharto moves Ining into a house on Jalan Jetis on
the slopes of Mount Merapi, adjacent to the forested areas where Ining
will train students to become guerrilla fighters. They toast the
occasion with whiskey brought from Manila.

[Military Babysitter]{cat="scene"}[21 October 1947]{cat="date"}  Muharto sees that Ining is isolated living among
the youth militia in the forest. He asks George Rueneker to keep Ining company in
his absence. George witnesses Ining berate the young recruits and sees
the displeasure on their faces. Ining asks George to bring whiskey
whenever his visits.

[Letter to the Major]{cat="scene"}[30 November 1947]{cat="date"}  Ining writes a letter Major Primitivo asking to be
relieved of his assignment and returned home. He rushes to Maguwo, but
is seconds too late to give it to Muharto to take to Manila. George, on
duty as flight controller, is on the tarmac. He sees that Ining is
upset, so he asks Muharto's brother, Mas Ded, to take Ining back to
Jalan Jetis and stay with him until his calms down.
