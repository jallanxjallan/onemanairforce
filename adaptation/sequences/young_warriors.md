[SLUGLINE]{name="Cameron Interviews George Rueneker"
date="21 July 1988"}  Sanyoto introduces Cameron to George Rueneker, a retired Air Force officer who owns a successful charter airline. George Rueneker tells Cameron the tragic story of
Captain Espina, or Ining.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Ining Will Train Students" date="22 October 1947"}
Muharto installs Ining in a house on the slopes of Mount Merapi, adjecent to the forests where he will train his young recruits. As Muharto will be frequently on missions with RI-002, he asks George to look after Ining in his absence. 

[SLUGLINE]{name="Military Babysitter" date="30 October 1947"} George visits Ining every few days. He grows increasingly disturbed to see the anger in their faces as Ining yells at
the recruits. Ining is obviously unhappy at being isolated among these foreign youths, none of whom can speak English. Ining insists that Muharto bring him bottles of whiskey whenever RI-002 returns from Manila. 

[SLUGLINE]{name="Ining Asks To Return" date="30 November 1947"} Ining
writes a letter to Major Primitivo begging to be recalled, but arrives
at Maguwo seconds too late to give to Muharto. George Rueneker, on duty
that evening, sees Ining is drunken and distraught, and asks Mas Ded,
Muharto's brother, to escort him back to Jalan Jetis and stay with him
until his calms down.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Young Warriors" category="interview" date="21 July 1988" location="Earthquake"}  George tells Cameron that Ining and Mas Ded were found at the Jalan Jetis house a few days later, both dead of gunshot wounds. The incident was labelled an accident, and Ining's body secretly returned to Manila on RI-002.
