Sabam Siagian, a well-groomed, middle-aged Indonesian who is managing
editor of the Jakarta Post, the nation's leading English-language
newspaper, assigns Cameron, an American post-grad student on a one-year internship, to interview his long-time friend Petit Muharto. As a captain in the Indonesian Air Force during the post-war struggle for independence, Muharto had been the co-pilot of RI-002, a war-surplus C-47 owned by American veteran pilot Bob Freeberg chartered by the Air Force to run the Dutch-imposed blockade around the territories claimed by the newly declared Republic of Indonesia. 

Cameron meets Muharto, a dapper, energetic Indonesian man in his
late sixties, at his tidy residence in a Jakarta suburb. Muharto recounts his exploits in RI-002 in such vivid detail that Cameron can clearly visualize the events Muharto is describing starting with a surprise telephone call he received at Maguwo Airbase in Jogjakarta on June 1947.

> En route to the location, Muharto remembers the foreign pilots he had commissioned for blockade runs earlier in the year, and decided it must be Bob Freeberg. The other pilots had treated the flights as purely commercial assignments -- the crew had even included a flight attendant, Miss Brown, a comely Filipina. But Bob had been willing to undertake risky tasks on the return leg, including a test land on a jungle air strip and dropping paratroopers into a highland town. Only Bob, Muharto decides, was both the high level of skill and total lack of fear to fly into a hostile environment unannounced and

Muharto briefly recounts to Cameron the missions he undertook on RI-002 during the rest of the year, which were mostly mundane cargo runs between Jogjakarta and other nations in Southeast Asia to trade high-value commodities for essential goods not available in the blockaded capital such as medicine and electrical and automotive parts. But easily his most important mission was to fly some of the new nation's leading economists and technocrats to a United Nations conference in the Philippines. These delegates, all European educated and highly accomplished, treated Bob with profound respect, knowing that the fate of their nation might be in the hands of this freebooting foreign aviator.  

Muharto tells Cameron that in May 1948 he was promoted to Major and assigned administrative duties in Air Force headquarters. Thus, he was not able to accompany RI-002 on another crucial mission, carrying President Soekarno, who called Bob "our American friend", on a month-long morale- and fund-raising tour of Republican areas. But they had kept in contact, and Muharto looked forward to Bob attending his wedding on 24 October. Then, on 2 October 1948, Muharto learned that RI-002 had vanished while transporting a ton of Republican gold from Java to Sumatra. 

Muharto explains that nothing was
known of the crash, and the Dutch authorities denied all knowledge. In
April 1979, Muharto says, farmers searching the remote mountainside for
arable land stumble across aircraft wreckage. Muharto shows Cameron photographs taken by Air Force field investigators.

They had been here recently, Sulaiman assumes, as the rapid vegetation growth in this tropical rain forest would have obliterated all signs of their presence in a few months.

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob’s
remains, could not be buried with the others as a foreigner cannot be interred in a cemetery for national heroes, however much he may deserve the honor himself through his services to the nation.
Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash
site, wholly accident, some five years previously. He wrote his contacts
in the Air Force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site
investigation, but received only vague, non-committal replies --- or only
silence. 

Muharto’s expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying,
wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of
RI-002 than they are telling.
