[Old Comrade Reunion]{cat="scene"}[10 July 1988]{cat="date"}  Muharto organizes a meeting of former RI-002 crew, who tell stories of flying with Freeberg in 1947. One tells of flying paratroopers to Kalimantan. It was the first jump for all, and they had been reassured by the calm, confident presence of Freeberg at the controls. Another relates a humorous story of Freeberg being detained on what was supposed to be a day trip to Bangkok, forcing the crew to seek accommodation in the only place they could afford: the rolicking bar district.
