[Military Comfort Zone]{cat="scene"}[15 July 1988]{cat="date"}  Syd takes Cameron to the Earthquake Club near his rented room in Central Jakarta. Sanyoto, the owner and a close friend, was an Air Force drill sargeant, and later a fixer for foreign oil companies. Most patrons are senior military officers and government officials. Sanyoto introduces Cameron to Sudaryono, one of the first tranche of cadet pilots. Sudaryono relates amusing stories of the rivalry between the two best cadet pilots in the class: Bambang Sudarmadji and Moeljono, especially the crushing disappointment Bambang felt when on the morning of 29 July 1947 his fighter was grounded moments before the squadron took off to bomb Dutch positions, and could only stand on the tarmac and watch Moeljono fly away to glory.
