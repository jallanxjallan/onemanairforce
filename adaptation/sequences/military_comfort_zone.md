[SLUGLINE]{name="Cameron at the Earthquake" date="15 July 1988"} Syd
invites Cameron to join him for a drink at the the Earthquake, owned by
his friend Sanyoto, a former Air Force drill sargeant and a fixer for
foreign companies. Most of the patrons are senior military officers and
government officials who all hold Sanyoto in great respect. Sanyoto is
delighted to hear of the investigation into the RI-002 mystery, and
allows Cameron to interview his guests as long as he minds his manners.

[SLUGLINE]{name="Cameron Interviews George Rueneker"
date="21 July 1988"} Sanyoto introduces Cameron to George Rueneker, a retired Air Force officer who owns a successful charter airline. George tells Cameron that Muharto had installed Ining in a house on the slopes of Mount Merapi, adjacent to the forests where Ining will train his young recruits. As the presence of Ining was a secret, he was allowed no visitors, and could not enter the town. 

[SLUGLINE]{name="Military Babysitter" date="21 October 1947"} At the Jalan Jetis house, George is disturbed to see the anger in their faces as Ining yells at
the recruits. As usual, George reminds him to bring a bottle of whiskey on his next visit. 

[SLUGLINE]{name="Ining Asks To Return" date="30 November 1947"} Ining
writes a letter to Major Primitivo begging to be recalled, but arrives
at Maguwo seconds too late to give to Muharto. George Rueneker, on duty
that evening, sees Ining is drunken and distraught, and asks Mas Ded,
Muharto's brother, to escort him back to Jalan Jetis and stay with him
until he calms down.
