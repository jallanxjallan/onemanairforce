[Achmad the Guerrilla]{cat="scene"}[04 December 1947]{cat="date"}  During a routine radio contact with Jogja, Boedi is
told that Ining and Mas Ded were found dead of gunshot wounds at Ining's
house.

[Painful Memories]{cat="scene"}[22 July 1988]{cat="date"}  Cameron tells Muharto of his interview with George
Rueneker, and cajoles him into telling of the events following the
death of Ining. 

[Bought The Beach]{cat="scene"}[27 December 1947]{cat="date"}  RI-003 crashes on a beach in Malaya. Dutch embassy
representatives join the British investigation team at the crash site,
insisting that the aircraft had been attempting to smuggle guns into
Sumatra.

[Baseless Accusation]{cat="scene"}[18 December 1947]{cat="date"}  Muharto reports Ining's death to Primitivo. Muharto
is astounded when the major accuses Muharto and his late brother of
being clandestine communists, and detains Muharto for interrogation.

[Kaliurang Holiday]{cat="scene"}[24 December 1947]{cat="date"}  RI-002 returns to Jogja. Suryadarma tells Bob to lay
low while they deal with the fallout from Ining's death. Bob spends an
idyllic few days in Kaliurang, a resort on the slopes of Mount Merapi.

[Airworthiness Issues]{cat="scene"}[29 December 1947]{cat="date"}  RI-002 departs for Pekanbaru carrying 14 Republican
officials and a coffin containing Ining's remains. Bad weather over
Pekanbaru forces RI-002 to divert to Singapore. Dutch representatives on
the island pressure the British into grounding the Dakota because of
"airworthiness" issues.

[Finally To Manila]{cat="scene"}[15 January 1948]{cat="date"}  British officials open Ining's coffin, searching for
contraband. Finding none, and with RI-002 brought up to minimal
airworthiness standards, they grant Bob permission to depart, to the
great annoyance of the Dutch.
