``` synopsis
Cameron, an American journalism graduate doing a year's internship as a copy editor The Jakarta Post, an English-language daily newspaper, pitches a story idea to managing editor Sabam Siagian. Sabam rolls his eyes and explains, yet again, that, under the rules set down by the government,non-Indonesian newsroom staff cannot do actual reporting. Then Sabam relaxes his gruff demeanor and tells Cameron he can interview his old friend former Air Force officer Petit Muharto about his experiences during the post-war struggle against the Dutch. This is a feature, not news, and anyway, says Sabam "No one else has time."

Sabam Siagian, a well-groomed, middle-aged Indonesian who is managing
editor of the Jakarta Post, the nation's leading English-language
newspaper, assigns Cameron, an American post-grad student on a one-year
internship, to interview his long-time friend Petit Muharto. As a
captain in the Indonesian Air Force during the post-war struggle for
independence, Muharto had been the co-pilot of RI-002, a war-surplus
C-47 owned by American veteran pilot Bob Freeberg chartered by the Air
Force to run the Dutch-imposed blockade around the territories claimed
by the newly declared Republic of Indonesia.

Cameron, an American in his mid 20s, stands at the desk of a middle-aged
Indonesian man in the Jakarta Post newsroom. Cameron points to a sheet
of paper on the desk and lectures the older man in a condescending
manner about mistakes in English grammar. Sabam Siagian, a distinguished
Indonesian middle-aged man wearing a freshly pressed Safari suit, walks
past, seeing the annoyance on the reporter's face. Cameron sees Sabam
and follows him into his office. Inside the cramped office, Sabam sits
at a desk, almost disappearing behind precariously balanced piles of
folders and documents and starts searching for something. Cameron tries
to pitch a story idea, but Sabam waves him off, reminding the American
that he is a foreigner working in a technical capacity, and not an
accredited correspondent. The government is very strict on this matter,
he says. Then Sabam relents, looks through his papers, and pulls out a
card, handing it to Cameron. He explains that his old friend, Petit
Muharto Kartodirdjo, a former Air Force officer, has an interesting
story to tell about an American blockade runner who mysteriously
vanished on 1 October 1948. The coming Saturday will make the 40-year
anniversary of the disappearance. Since this is only a feature story in
a weekend edition about a historical incident, there is no harm in
letting Cameron do the interview. Besides, Sabam continues, no one else
has time to spare.
