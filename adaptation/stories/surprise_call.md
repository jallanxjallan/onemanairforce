``` synopsis
Flying to Tasik in a refurbished Japanese aircraft, whose pilot had only first seen an airplane a few months previously, Muharto takes his mind from possible catastrophe by recollecting his experiences during his blockade runs three months previously, wondering which pilot it might be.
```

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit
monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even
seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight,
Muharto pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it must be
Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before when he
accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the
Manilia-based CALI charter airline.

En route to the location, Muharto remembers the foreign pilots he had
commissioned for blockade runs earlier in the year, and decided it must
be Bob Freeberg. The other pilots had treated the flights as purely
commercial assignments -- the crew had even included a flight attendant,
Miss Brown, a comely Filipina. But Bob had been willing to undertake
risky tasks on the return leg, including a test land on a jungle air
strip and dropping paratroopers into a highland town. Only Bob, Muharto
decides, was both the high level of skill and total lack of fear to fly
into a hostile environment unannounced and to land safely on a remote
beach. --- date: 31 March 1947 location: CALI ---

``` {.synopsis}
On the third blockade run, with Bob Freeberg as captain, the overcast sky forces Muharto to navigate by asking Bob to fly low enough to follow the railway line to Jogja. 
```

Muharto stands in the cockpit between Bob and his co-pilot, guiding the
aircraft by landmarks he has seen twice before on previous blockade
runs. But today, overcast obscures the terrain save tops of the
volcanoes poking through the clouds. Miss Brown, a comely Filipina who,
incongruously, is the stewardess on what is basically an illegal flight,
hands Muharto a cup of tea, then looks at the solid overcast with
obvious concern.

Bob points to the peaks and asks if there is any high ground in between. Muharto thinks for a moment, then replies: I don't think so. Nothing above a few hundred meters. To Muharto's horror, Bob noses the aircraft down through the overcast, emerging perilously close to the terrain. Muharto gulps, and frantically looks for any type of landmark. He sees a rail line that he knows will lead them through valleys and plains all the way to Jogja. He tells Bob to follow that line, and Jogja appears a few minutes later, to Miss Brown's great relief.

The Nikosoren lands in Tasik. Muharto is met by Pang, and army lieutenant who had called him, and reveals that his commander thought Freeberg was a spy and wanted to shoot him. They load up a jeep with two barrels of aviation fuel and drive to the beach. 
```

Muharto meets Pang Suparto, the army officer who had telephoned him, and
together they take two barrels of aviation fuel to the beach where
Freeberg is stranded. On seeing the beach, Muharto is astounded that
Freeberg was able to land there safely.

Muharto tells Cameron that in Tasik he met Pang Soeparto, the junior army officer who telephoned him, who takes him (and two barrels of aviation fuel) to the beach at Cikolong. He tells Cameron that as soon as he saw the beach, bookended by two rivers and the gap between the water and palm trees scarcely more than the Dakota's wing span, he knew that, of all the pilots he had met, only Bob Freeberg had the skill to make that landing.

``` {.synopsis}
Muharto receives a telephone call from an army base in Tasikmalaya, reporting that a foreign pilot has landed on a remote beach nearby and asked for Muharto by name.   
```

Petit Muharto sits at his desk. An airman approaches his desk and speaks
(without saluting first) that he someone wants to speak to him on the
telephone. Muharto looks surprised, stands and walks to a neighboring
office, where the only telephone in the building is kept. He listens
intently, discerning only a few words through the crackle of static:
"Tasikmalaya base", "Foreign pilot", "Captain Petit Muharto".
