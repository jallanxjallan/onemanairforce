Cameron writes up the interview at the Jakarta Times, an English-language daily newspaper run as a hobby by a business mogul who wants to promote foreign investment in Indonesia. The owner lets Cameron use a desk, telephone, and fax in exchange for favors like this article. Cameron gives the draft to Syd Jardine, an Old Asia Hand who is the offical language consultant, but unoffical managing editor. Syd remarks that Freeberg comes off
as a "white savior" who alone was responsible for saving the Republic. He suggests Cameron flesh out the story with accounts of Bob in the reference section of the newly
opened National Library.
