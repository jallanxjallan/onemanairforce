Affandi dashes off and signs a self-portrait for Cameron to give to Boedi.
```

Cameron asks what happened to the painting. Affandi laughs and explains
that he and his friends at buried the propaganda paintings in the forest
when the Dutch overran Jogja. When the Dutch withdrew from Jogja six
months later, they returned to the forest, only to discover that
villagers had dug them up in the meantime. Muharto reappears, greets
Affandi with respect, and tells Cameron it is time to go. Affandi grabs
a sketch pad, dashes off a self-portrait, signs it, and hands it
Cameron, explaining that it was a gift for Boedi to thank him for
sending him a new friend. --- date: October 1947 location: Maguwo

Affandi sketches Bob in front of RI-002.
```

Affandi is sketching at the edge of the runway, near where RI-002 is
parked. Bob walks up to him and compliments the sketch. Affandi, who
speaks some English, asks Bob to briefly pose for him. Affandi was
struck at the immense respect Bob enjoyed from military and government
officials, and the adoration, the outright hero worship, of the common
Indonesians. Affandi painted Freeberg standing in front of RI-002 as
though he were Bima, a hero in the wayang legends of ancient Java.
Freeberg, like Bima, was tall and imposing, strong and exceptionally
skilled. And, like Bima, Freeberg was modest and unpretentious, a gentle
soul in a warrior's body. --- date: April 1949 location: forest outside

Cameron meets Affandi, who tells him amusing stories of making propaganda posters to raise morale during the blockade. 
```

Muharto drops Cameron at the entrance to the Affandi museum, says he
will pick him up again in two hours, then drives away. Affandi, an
animated, disheveled elderly man, is sitting on a bench on the grounds
of the compound, as though he is homeless person seeking rest, not the
owner of the sprawling estate and a fortune in paintings and sculptures.
Affandi greets Cameron pleasantly, in English, and then becomes effusive
when Cameron brings greetings from Boedi. The fall into animated
conversation. Cameron explains the purpose of his visit, and Affandi
launches into a humorous and poignant narrative of painting propaganda
posters amid the privation and danger of besieged Jogjakarta, including
an encounter with Bob Freeberg.
