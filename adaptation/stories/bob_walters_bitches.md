In August 1947 the gregarious and charismatic Boedi had been wholly
accepted by the Aviation Brotherhood, the freewheeling foreign pilots
seeking their fortunes or reliving wartime adventures in often-dangerous
charter flights into remote areas of the region. At the AB bar, Boedi
learns more about Bob, particularly the recognition by his peers that he
is the most skillful and courageous aviator in Southeast Asia. Boedi
also learns that Freeberg is in considerable financial difficulty, and
is in a legal battle with another aviator, Bob Walters, his partner in
purchasing the aircraft now known as RI-002. Walters is scathing in his
condemnation, calling Bob a thief and a con man.
