In Maguwo on the evening of 10 June 1947, Suryadarma commissions Bob to
fly a cargo of high-value quinine to Manila and return with essential
medicines and spare parts. Muharto expresses concern about the reception
that might await unmarked aircraft carrying high-value goods into
Manila. He suggests that they paint a fictitious registration number
onto the tail. Muharto suggests RI-002. Bob says it should be RI-001, as
his is the first aircraft. Suryadarma, imperiously, states that "RI-001"
is reserved for a future presidential aircraft. Bob grumbles as
Suryadarma issues the order to paint the number on the Dakota's tail.
