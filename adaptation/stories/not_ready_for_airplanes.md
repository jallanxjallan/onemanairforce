In early May 1948, Bob waits in the pre-dawn gloom for Bambang and the
crew to show up for an opium run. They drive up after dawn, laughing and
joking. Bob is furious, but keeps his voice measured, telling Bambang
and the others that they are "Not Ready for Airplanes", they jumping
into their automobile and telling the driver to take him back to the
hotel.
