Arriving at work one day in September 1947, Victor sees a sealed
envelope on his desk that he knows to be reassignment orders. He opens
the envelope with dread, certain that he is being sent to a combat unit.
But the orders are for Victor to report to KNIL headquarters, where he
will work as an assistant photographic technician and analyst with
Spoor's intelligence unit.
