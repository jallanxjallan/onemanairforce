One evening at the Earthquake, the music is supplied by a band playing keroncong, a
guitar-driven genre that features sentimental Dutch-language lyrics.
Regarded as "music for old folks" the audience of senior and retired
military officers laps it up. Afterward, Sanyoto introduces Syd and
Cameron to Samuel Quiko, the band leader. Sanyoto mentions that Samuel
had been active in the revolution, and might have interesting stories to
tell.
