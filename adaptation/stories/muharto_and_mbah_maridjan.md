``` {.synopsis}
Cameron accompanies Muharto to a village on the upper slopes of the
Merapi volcano to meet Muhartoâ€™s spiritual advisor, Mbah Maridjan. The
three hike the steep incline to a shrine, effortlessly in the case of
the sexagenarian duo, but with some difficulty by their companion, some
four decades their junior. Cameron watches respectfully as the two
intone Islamic prayers, then lay Hindu-style floral offerings at the
shrine to the gods of the fire mountain.
