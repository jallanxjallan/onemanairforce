``` synopsis}
Cameron pulls up at the hotel entrance, impressing Julia's friends, who
are waiting for her by the door. Cameron drives away to park his Harley,
while Julia and her friends go to their event, a birthday party for
another general's daughter where the gifts include a house and a car.
The friends press Julia for information about Cameron, and suggest that
since he rides a huge motorcycle, and is a *bule*, he must be rich,
teasing her that since her father, unlike other generals, does not give
his daughter unlimited amounts of money, she needs a rich boyfriend.
```


Cameron and Julia walk into the lobby of the Hotel Borobudur together,
where her friends are waiting. Julia introduces Cameron to them, then he
walks toward the bar. Julia's friends grill her about the bule, with
Julia insisting that they are not even friends, just new acquaintances.
The friends, who are all *anak jendral*, insist that Julia should go out
with him. All bule are rich, they say, and maybe with his money Julia
can finally come with them on shopping trips to Singapore.
