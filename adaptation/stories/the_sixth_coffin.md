``` synopsis
In an otherwise empty hanger, five coffins draped in Indonesian flags
lay on a platform. A sixth coffin, larger than the rest and without a
flag, rests on a separate platform. A flatbed truck pulls into the
hanger and a squad of airmen, in silence, pick up each
of the coffins and place them on the truck. But they leave the sixth
coffin where it lies as the truck pulls away.
