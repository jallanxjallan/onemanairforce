title: Muharto Introduces Freeberg
---
Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting
with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when
they hear the roar of a large motorcycle approaching. Muharto, in jest,
covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in
front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani
opens it to find Cameron Bishop, an engaging, disheveled young American, who says has an appointment to interview Muharto about his experiences with Bob Freeberg. Muharto recovers from his astonishment that his old friend Sabam Siagian, managing editor of The Jakarta Post, has send a "Hell's Angel" to interview him, and begins by telling Cameron of a message he received one
morning at his desk in Maguwo air base in Jogjakarta.
