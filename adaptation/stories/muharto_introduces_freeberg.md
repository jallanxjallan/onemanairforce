On 25 September 1988, Cameron Bishop, an American journalism student
interning at The Jakarta Post as a copy editor, sits with retired Air
Force Major Petit Muharto at his home in Jakarta. Muharto had asked his
old friend Sabam Siagian, the English-language newspaper's managing
editor, to publish a story commemorating Bob Freeberg on the 40th
anniversary of his mysterious disappearance on 1 October 1948. Muharto
begins his narrative by telling Cameron of a message he received one
morning at his desk in Maguwo air base in Jogjakarta.
