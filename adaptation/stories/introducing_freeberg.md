``` synopsis
Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when they hear the roar of a large motorcycle approaching. Muharto, in jest, covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani opens it to find Cameron, in jeans and motorcycle boots, asking for Muharto. 
Once over his surprise at being interviewed by a "Hell's Angel" Muharto tells the story of the Bob Freeberg and RI-002, beginning with a surprise call he received a his desk in Maguwo Air Base in Jogjakarta.
