In early November 1988 Cameron and Julia have dinner with Muharto and
Ani. Afterward, Cameron and Muharto fall deep into discussion about the
revelations of their investigations. By this point, both Ani and Julia
think they are plummeting down a conspiracy rabbit hole, but keep their
views to themselves. Instead Ani tells Julia stories when her husband
was a dashing young officer, and the hardships of life in besieged
Jogja.
