On 20 October 1947 Bob flies two Indonesian aviators, Halim and Iswandi,
to Bangkok where they will purchase a twin-prop airplane that will
become RI-003. Dutch authorities pressure the Thai government to detain
Freeberg as a blockade runner. The Thais briefly detain Freeberg in a
comfortable hotel room, but the Indonesian crew must find their own
accommodation. They can only afford rooms in a bar district. Boedi is
delighted, but Halim and Iswandi are appalled. Both are engaged to be
married, and worry that the families of their fianc√©es will learn that
they have stayed in such a disreputable environment.
