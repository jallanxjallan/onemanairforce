In mid October 1988, Julia is processing a shipment of English-language
books about Indonesia for inclusion in the library collection. One book,
*Our Hotel in Bali*, catches her eye, as the author is Louise Koke. A
quick glance at the contents confirms that Louise is the wife of Robert
Koke, and the book about the couple running Bali's first "bohemian-chic"
hotel in the 1930s. The portrait of Robert Koke emerging from the pages
wholly contradicts the perception of a CIA officer seeking to
destabilize a regime. Julia writes a letter to the publisher, requesting
it be passed to the Kokes.
