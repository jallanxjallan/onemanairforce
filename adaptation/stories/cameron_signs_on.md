``` synopsis
Cameron puts down the phone, grins, and says to Muharto: "I'm in!"  Muharto is delighted. He suggests they first visit Boediardjo, the radio operator on RI-002. 
```

Cameron visits Muharto to say that he would like to help Muharto finally
solve the mystery of RI-002. Muharto is delighted, saying that a good
place to start would be the Aviation Museum in Jogjakarta, where the
items recovered from the RI-002 wreckage are stored. In addition, he
could visit his spiritual advisor there to seek supernatural blessing 
for a successful outcome of their endeavors.
