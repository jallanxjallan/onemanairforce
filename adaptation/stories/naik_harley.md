Cameron and Julia discover that they are now headed to the same destination: the Hotel Borobudur, a nearby luxury hotel, where she will meet friends in the coffee shop, and he a mate at the bar. Cameron offers Julia a ride. She accepts, and is nonplussed when he takes her to an army surplus Harley Davidson motorcycle in the parking lot. During the thrilling ride, she briefly grabs Cameron's waist, to her embarrassment.

Cameron pulls up at the hotel entrance, impressing Julia's friends, who are waiting for her by the door. Cameron drives away to park his Harley, while Julia and her friends go to their event, a birthday party for another general's daughter where the gifts include a house and a car. The friends press Julia for information about Cameron, and suggest that since he rides a huge motorcycle, and is a bule, he must be rich, teasing her that since her father, unlike other generals, does not give his daughter unlimited amounts of money, she needs a rich boyfriend.
