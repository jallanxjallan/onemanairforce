```synopsis
Victor covers an exhibition that includes a few paintings by Emeria Soenassa, a charasmatic, stylish woman in her mid-thirties who is the only female Indonesian modern artist. Emeria flirts with Victor, as she does with Auke Sonnega and the other young Europeans at the event. 

In the resulting article, Victor singles out Emeria as an exceptional talent. Emeria contacts the newspaper to invite Victor to her studio and see more of her work.
