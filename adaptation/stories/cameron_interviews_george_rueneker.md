In late October 1988, while Cameron drinks alone in the Earthquake,
Sanyoto introduces him to George Rueneker, a retired Air Force officer
who owns an aviation-services company. George is of mixed
European-Indonesian heritage and, like many of his fellow "Indos"
decided to support the Indonesian struggle for freedom.
