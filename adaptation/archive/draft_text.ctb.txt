```synopsis
Like these officers, I elected to stay in Jogjakarta, though
I had no intention of surrendering. I had a new bride to pro-
tect. Ironically, Ani had to leap to my own defense the after-
noon of the invasion. Shortly after nightfall Ani and I, along
with many others, were detained by Dutch troops as we passed
through the market on our way home.
     “Oh dear!” I whispered to Ani, “It's a Westerling Sweep.”
      This was bad news indeed. Speaking fluent Dutch, Ani ar-
gued with the sergeant, distracting attention while I surrepti-
tiously chewed and swallowed my Air Force identification papers.
The sergeant told Ani that she was free to go. However, I would
be detained for interrogation. Adopting the imperious attitude
that all high-born Javanese women can summon when neces-
sary, Ani berated the sergeant.
     “Very well,” she said, “but one of you must escort
me home. It is not seemly for a married woman to be
alone on the street at this hour!”
      Trapped between duty and gallantry, the sergeant was sty-
mied. He looked around helplessly. Then, another Dutch soldier
                        WESTERLING SWEEP                           269
    appeared. Dressed in khaki, he wore no insignia, but his confi-
    dent manner, and the deference afforded him by the sergeant and
    troops, left no doubt as to who was in command.
          Fearing an ambush, the presumed officer forbade the troops
    to enter a native area. Ani then demanded to know why I was
    being detained. The officer explained that the khaki pants I wore
    indicated I might be a rebel soldier.
         “The nerve!” Ani retorted. “My husband is wearing
    those ugly things only because they are the only pants avail-
    able in the market. Because of your blockade, we have to
    wear whatever rags we can find!”
          I struggled to keep a grin off my face as the officer endured
    a tongue-lashing from this mere slip of a native girl. Finally, he let
    both of us go, and we hurried home to plan our next move.

Several of the Indonesian map makers are amateur artists, and so Victor is invited to accompany them to the exhibitions of Batavia's vibrant arts scene. At an event featuring the flamboyant Dutch artist Auke Sonnega, the artist overhears Victor giving astute criticism of his paintings. He introduces himself and suggests Victor write up some notes and send them, along with the photos, to a friend who works for the *Bataviaasch Nieuwsblad* newspaper. Victor becomes a regular contributor to the paper, covering the arts circuit and doing photographic essays on street life, all while concealing his status as a KNIL recruit.

# Treatment

As Muharto and Pang walk over
the soft sand toward the Dakota, Muharto sees Bob Freeberg crouched beside a wheel, digging away the sand with a shovel. The man turns around and grins when he sees Muharto approaching. 

Muharto sees that the Dakota is undamaged but stuck in the soft sand.
They first try to fashion a runway from coconut fronds, but the leaves
disintegrate under the wheels of the heavy Dakota. By this time
hundreds of villagers had arrived to witness the outlandish spectacle.
Muharto looks around the village, and notices that most houses have
walls of woven bamboo. He gets an idea, climbs with Bob onto the wing of
the Dakota, and launches into an impassioned speech saying that this
brave foreigner is our friend and will help us drive the despised Dutch
from our land. The villagers cheer, and Muharto is joined by Pang, the
army officer, who tells the assembled crowd to, literally, tear their
own houses apart to lay the bamboo mats on the sand. A few hours later,
the Dakota, which Muharto on board, takes off and flies away, the mats
flying backwards in the propeller backwash.

Sabam turns, and Cameron hands him the sheets of paper. He grunts, hands them back to Cameron, and tells him that the piece needs more background, suggesting he go to the library and read a book he had discovered in the reference section: *Recruit to Revolution*

says: "Needs more background"

glances at them, grunts, then hands them to Syd and strides out the door, followed by his driver carrying Sabam's briefcase.

Muharto tells Cameron and Syd that he is still disturbed by the inability, or perhaps reluctance, of the retired officers to provide information. Muharto wonders if they know what had happened to the gold. If, as Sulaiman suspected, the crash site had been visited by a military outfit, who would have been capable of extracting the gold, then perhaps the officers did not want to stir up trouble. 

An office boy arrives with a stack of copies for Muharto. He thanks everyone and takes his leave. Cameron tells Syd that, if what Muharto suspects is correct, this is a great story. Syd advises Cameron to not get involved, as who knows where this might lead. But Cameron is adamant, so Syd suggests he invent a cover story.

Syd says it would be, if it had an ending. Publishers don't like to keep readers hanging. 
So, Cameron says, I'll solve the mystery.

Cameron tells Sabam he has decided to do his grad thesis on the revolution. As he leaves the office, Sabam calls him back, suggesting he start at the National Library new reference section, where he recently read Recruit to Revolution. 

Cameron agrees, and later tells Sabam that he  would like to do more research into the story as a basis for a grad-school paper when he returns home. Sabam wishes him luck, and recommends a book he had found in the reference section of the newly opened National Library a few weeks before. Sabam also reminds Cameron to do this on his own time, and not to involve the Jakarta Post.

Instead, however, an official asked Bob to identify his copilot. This
was evidently a requirement for a Dakota on an international flight. Bob
looked around helplessly until I stepped forward and said: "I am the
copilot!" After all, I had been sitting in the right-hand seat when we
landed. "Please show me your license," the official said. I hesitated
and then took out my Air Force identification card. In Indonesian, it
read: Muharto: Opsir Udara III. During this period, the English
translation of my rank would have been Flight Lieutenant. This rank does
not necessarily indicate that I could actually fly an airplane. On the
reasonable assumption that 58 ONE MAN AIR FORCE none of the Filipinos

Muharto, in jest, covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani opens it to find Cameron, in jeans and motorcycle boots, asking for Muharto. 
Once over his surprise at being interviewed by a "Hell's Angel" Muharto tells the story of the Bob Freeberg and RI-002, beginning with a surprise call he received a his desk in Maguwo Air Base in Jogjakarta.  
```

```sixth_coffin
Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bobâs
remains, could not be buried with the others as a foreigner cannot be interred in a cemetery for national heroes, however much he may deserve the honor himself through his services to the nation.

Muhartoâs expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto wonders that if he had turned down promotion and had been with Bob on the final flight, maybe it would not have ended in tragedy. 
```

Muharto ends his recollection by explaining how Freeberg vanished  while transporting a fortune in gold to safety ahead of an expected Dutch invasion. Farmers had stumbled upon the wreckage of RI-002 on a remote mountainside ten years previously, but could not identify Freeberg's remains from the few fragments of bones they found. Cameron senses the genuine sadness in Muharto that the fate of his friend and fellow pilot remains unknown.  

Muharto tells Cameron that the sixth coffin, presumably containing Bob's
remains, could not be buried with the others because he was a foreigner.
Muharto explains that he became aware of the discovery of the crash
site, wholly accident, some five years previously. He wrote his contacts
in the air force and to the officers who participated in the crash-site
investigation, but received only vague, non-committal replies -- or only
silence. Muharto's expression as he finished his reminiscences convinces
Cameron that he regarded Freeberg as a close friend, and is seeking
closure about his mysterious disappearance. Muharto finishes by saying,
wistfully, that his is sure many people know more about the mystery of
RI-002 than they are telling.

    Bob readily agrees. They circle the strip and Bob ponders the attempt.
    Muharto asks if he can land a plane this size. Bob replies that he did
    this all the time in the war. He can "land on a dime and give you a
    nickel change." 

    Bob makes a spectacular landing, engines roaring with reverse thrust. Muharto asks if he can take off again. Bob replies:
    "I hope so. We seem to be smack dab in the middle of nowhere." 

    Santoso, the base commander climbs aboard to meet them.
    After a short conversation, Santoso exits, and Bob takes off, the wheels
    finally lifting off the runway a few meters before the end.

In Bukittinggi, Dave Fowler looks on in shock as the right-side landing
gear collapses just as RI-002 is planning to take off. Bob grins, and
says: "You know how it is. 99 times out of a hundred you can get away
with it." Fowler replies: "I guess this was the 100th time."

Bob and the ground crew jack up the wing on blocks as Bob resets the
gear, then walks along the wing checking for cracks. He sees one sizable
crack, kneels down to inspect it, then shouts to Fowler that "it will
hold", Bob goes back to the cabin, fires up the engines, and takes off

# Meeting Muharto
Petit Muharto, a lively, dapper Indonesian in his late 60s, is sitting with his wife Ani in their cosy living room in the Jakarta suburbs when they hear the roar of a large motorcycle approaching. Muharto, in jest, covers his ears, and is then surprised when the motorcycle stops in front of their house. A moment later, there is a knock on the door. Ani opens it to find Cameron, in jeans and motorcycle boots, asking for Muharto. 

Once over his surprise at being interviewed by a "Hell's Angel" Muharto tells the story of the Bob Freeberg and RI-002, beginning with a surprise call he received a his desk in Maguwo Air Base in Jogjakarta. 

# Flight to Tasik

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit
monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even
seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight,
Muharto pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it must be
Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before when he
accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the
Manilia-based CALI charter airline.

# Muharto Investigates
Muharto tells Cameron that the situation was so chaotic, with the Dutch threatening to invade the Republic, that a proper search of the rugged terrain on the flight path was not possible. A few years previously Muharto had began his own investigations in AURI archives, finding the report of the team sent to investigate the crash site.

RI-002 returns to Jogja, flying non-stop to conceal the presence of Captain Espina. They reach Java after dusk, with landmarks difficult to discern in the gloom. After some hesitation, during which tension rises in the cockpit, Muharto draws upon a vivid schoolboy memory to identify a range of hills and guides the aircraft to Jogja.

# 

```

RI-002 returns to Jogja with their clandestine passenger, Captain
Espina. The need for secrecy compels Freeberg to fly non-stop from the
southernmost military airfield in the Philippines to Jogjakarta. Bob
installs a spare fuel tank, but high winds deplete the reserve delay
contact with Java until after dark. Muharto has difficulty identifying
landmarks in the gloom, and tension mounts in the cabin as the fuels
gauges slide toward empty. Finally, Muharto draws on the vivid schoolboy
memory of his classmates describing a range of low, rounded hills near
Jogja as female breasts. He orients himself by the landmark geographic
feature and guides Bob to a safe landing in Jogja. RI-002 flies between
the volcanic peaks of Java, which throw ominous shadows over the land in
as the sun sets. Since the presence of Captain Espina could not be
revealed, RI-002 was forced to fly non-stop from Manila, extending the
range with a spare fuel tank installed in the cargo hold. That was now
empty, as well as the wing tanks. Freeberg asks Muharto to identify
landmarks with increasing urgency. Muharto peers out the window, unsure
of what can barely make out in the gathering gloom. Finally, Freeberg
almost shouts: "Dammit Muharto! Where are we? You should know! This is
your country!" A nervous laugh escapes Muharto's lips, as usual for an
embarrassed Javanese person. Muharto looks out the cockpit window again,
and again laughs, this time in delight at a schoolboy memory. Muharto
has spotted a line of low, rounded hills that he and his school mates
called, naturally, the "Susu Seribu", the Thousand Breasts. With this
vivid memory trigger Muharto can clearly visualize the relevant page in
his school atlas. Now with authority in his voice, he tells Freeberg:
"Fly toward those hills, turn to the west and follow them until the last
one, then turn back north and fly for 30 kilometers." A few minutes
later, RI-002 lands in Maguwo, the engines sputtering to a halt as it
rolls along the runway.

Finally, in September we flew back to Jogja. Boedi tells of tension in
the cockpit as Muharto prevaricates. Then finally, Muharto comes
through. He asks Boedi about the hills in front of them. They agree they
are the susu seribut that they tittered over in middle school. We
arrived long after dark. We could not announce our arrival. Our radio
was working, but the spare parts needed for the base radio was our cargo
cabin. As we approached, all the lights in the city flickered out. Then
points of light, flashlights pointed skyward, appeared throughout the
town. These were Dutch sympathizers, signaling what they thought was a
Dutch aircraft, a reminder that not all Indonesians were on our side. We
had to get the runway lights on. I told Bob about the signal a CALI crew
had used on the first blockade run, playing with the propeller pitch and
speed controls to produce an undulating drone, like a low-pitched siren.
Bob did this, and a few moments later the runway lights blazed on, and
we landed.

by calling a plantation expert to testify that the Republic does not
have the capability to process quinine, so the drug must have been
produced in a Dutch-owed factory before the war. Muharto jumps to his
feet, ready to protest this insult to his people's technological skill,
but Penatun motions for him to sit down, then calmly tells the judge: "A
foreigner is not qualified to discuss the internal matters of the

Cameron Bishop, a well-groomed American in his mid-twenties who displays the intellectual arrogance of an Ivy-league post-grad student, stands at the desk of a middle-aged
Indonesian reporter, his shirt wrinkled and sweaty from a long day on his beat. Cameron points to a sheet
of paper on the desk and lectures the older man in a condescending
manner about his minor mistakes in English grammar. 

Sabam Siagian, a distinguished
middle-aged Indonesian man wearing a freshly pressed Safari suit, walks
past, and notices the annoyance on the reporter's face. Cameron sees Sabam
and follows him into his office. Sabam sits
at a desk  taking up most of the space of the cramped office, almost disappearing behind precariously balanced piles of
folders and documents, and starts searching for something. Cameron tries
to pitch a story idea, but Sabam waves him off, reminding the American
that he is a foreigner working in a technical capacity as an English-language consultant, and not an
accredited correspondent. The government is very strict on this matter, Sabam reminds him. 

Then Sabam relents, looks through his papers, and pulls out a
card, handing it to Cameron. Sabam explains that an long-time friend, Petit
Muharto Kartodirdjo, a former Air Force officer, has an interesting
story to tell about an American blockade runner who mysteriously
vanished on 1 October 1948. The coming Saturday will mark the 40-year
anniversary of the disappearance. Since this is only a feature story in
a weekend edition about a historical incident, there is no harm in
letting Cameron do the interview. Besides, Sabam continues, no one else
has time to spare.

glances at them, grunts, then hands them to Syd and strides out the door, followed by his driver carrying Sabam's briefcase. 

Syd reads the piece, and says it needs a photo of Freeberg himself, not just the generic photos that Muharto gave him. Syd suggests that Cameron try the Indonesian Photo Agency, IPPHOS, who have an extensive collection of images from the period. An old Dutch-born photojournalist, Victor, looks after the place. "He will find one", Syd says. "He has, literally, a 'photographic memory'".

```draft
Cameron writes up the interview, and gives it to Sabam. However, Sabam is on his way to a diplomatic dinner, and simply hands the pages to Syd, an American  retired foreign correspondent who works as senior copy editor, and rushes out the door. Syd reads the piece, and suggests that Cameron corroborate 
Muharto's story with newspaper and other reports, which he can find at the newly opened National Library. 

In the Jakarta Post newsroom, Cameron finishes the first draft of the
Muharto interview, then hands it to Syd Jardine, a disheveled,
chain-smoking, older American sitting at the adjacent desk. After
reading it, Syd tells Cameron that the article is good, but a bit thin,
and needs more context to be understandable to the Post's foreign
readership. Syd suggests Cameron go to the national library and read the
book *Recruit to Revolution*, which has a chapter on Freeberg, and all
the historical background Cameron needs.



says it is an "important piece of Indonesian history." However, he noticed that, bases on his own extensive readings of the period, Muharto has misremembered some historical events. Syd  
suggests that Cameron fact-check the piece by reading contemporaneous newspaper accounts available in the newly opened national library. Syd tells Cameron that a friend of his, Victor, a Dutch national turned Indonesian who was noted journalist in the Soekarno era, is in the archives section most most mornings. He would be happy to give Cameron a hand.

```

Sabam strides into the newsroom, brandishing a copy of the paper, and
approaches a disheveled, chain-smoking older American sitting at the
desk adjacent to Cameron. Sabam points to an article headlined "Ladyboy
Molested By Sex-Crazed Gang", and says: "This is a family newspaper!".

Sabam then turns to Cameron, still holding the paper, and points to
another page with a photo of Bob Freeberg. He says that Muharto was
delighted with the article. Cameron agrees that was an intriguing story,
and says he would like to do some follow-up research. Sabam nods in
agreement, saying "On your own time, of course" and suggests he start
with a book he had recently stumbled across in the reference section of
the new national library. He writes the name of the book in the margin
of the paper in his hand, leaves it on Cameron's desk, and returns to
his office.

Cameron picks of a copy of the newspaper on his desk, turns a page, and
reads aloud: "And then the rapists took their turns to quench their
unnatural desires with the body of the hapless transvestite
hairdresser." The article carries the byline: "Our Reporter". Cameron
asks the American, Syd, how he gets away with it. Syd replies that he
and Sabam go way back. Sabam's biggest worry is that Cameron or another
foreign copy editors are not sufficiently familiar with the fine points
of Indonesian culture and history, and will let something slip through
that will rile some high official. Sabam relies on Syd as the last pair
of eyes before it all goes to press.

"Doing proper journalism in Indonesia is like walking a tightrope," Syd
says, "and I'm the safety net." Syd then turns away and takes a metal
flask from his desk drawer. There is a slight tremor in his hand as he
pours a splash from the flask into his coffee, replaces the flask in his
desk, and goes back to work.

Sabam storms out of his office, slams a copy of the paper in front of
Syd. He points to the headline: **Ladyboy Molested By Sex-Crazed**
**Gang**, and shouts: "This is a family newspaper!"

Sabam then turns to Cameron, now calm and composed, and says that
Muharto was delighted with the article about Freeberg and RI-002.
Cameron thanks Sabam for the praise, and says that he would like to do
more research into the story as a basis for a grad-school paper when he
returns home. Sabam agrees it would be an interesting and challenging
research topic, and wishes him luck. As he returns to his office, Sabam
turns back to Cameron and says: "On your own time, course. And don't
involve The Jakarta Post. You don't have a research permit so keep it
quiet."

After Sabam returns to his office, Syd tells Cameron that Sabam is
right. The government does not like journalists or academics reexamining
the past. If the fate of Bob Freeberg remains a mystery, they must think
it is for good reason, perhaps to avoid questions about what might have
happened to the gold.

Muharto receives a telephone call from Pang Suparto, an army officer serving at a base in Tasikmalaya. about 300 km to the west of Jogjakarta. Pang tells Muharto that a foreign pilot has landed a C-47 military cargo aircraft on a nearby beach.  When Pang, who speaks little English, questioned the pilot, he asked for Muharto by name. Muharto reports the surprising call to Suryadarma, the commander of the Air Force. Suryadarma grins, saying: âMust be one of your foreign flyboysâ, and sends Muharto to Tasik to investigate.

```draft
Flying to Tasik in a refurbished Japanese aircraft, whose pilot had only first seen an airplane a few months previously, Muharto takes his mind from possible catastrophe by recollecting his experiences during his blockade runs three months previously. He decides that only one pilot of his acquaintance has the skills and nerve to land a Dakota on an unknown beach: Bob Freeberg. 

------

Muharto tells Cameron that he flew to Tasik in a powerful, open-cockpit
monoplane flown by a pilot barely out of his teens and who had not even
seen an airplane until the previous year. During the 30-minute flight,
Muharto pondered who the American pilot might be, and decided it must be
Bob Freeberg. He remembered meeting Freeberg two months before when he
accompanied the third blockade run he had organized with the
Manilia-based CALI charter airline.

En route to the location, Muharto remembers the foreign pilots he had
commissioned for blockade runs earlier in the year, and decided it must
be Bob Freeberg. The other pilots had treated the flights as purely
commercial assignments -- the crew had even included a flight attendant,
Miss Brown, a comely Filipina. But Bob had been willing to undertake
risky tasks on the return leg, including a test land on a jungle air
strip and dropping paratroopers into a highland town. Only Bob, Muharto
decides, was both the high level of skill and total lack of fear to fly
into a hostile environment unannounced and to land safely on a remote
beach. 

On the third blockade run, with Bob Freeberg as captain, the overcast sky forces Muharto to navigate by asking Bob to fly low enough to follow the railway line to Jogja. 

Muharto stands in the cockpit between Bob and his co-pilot, guiding the
aircraft by landmarks he has seen twice before on previous blockade
runs. But today, overcast obscures the terrain save tops of the
volcanoes poking through the clouds. Miss Brown, a comely Filipina who,
incongruously, is the stewardess on what is basically an illegal flight,
hands Muharto a cup of tea, then looks at the solid overcast with
obvious concern.

Bob points to the peaks and asks if there is any high ground in between. Muharto thinks for a moment, then replies: I don't think so. Nothing above a few hundred meters. To Muharto's horror, Bob noses the aircraft down through the overcast, emerging perilously close to the terrain. Muharto gulps, and frantically looks for any type of landmark. He sees a rail line that he knows will lead them through valleys and plains all the way to Jogja. He tells Bob to follow that line, and Jogja appears a few minutes later, to Miss Brown's great relief.

The Nikosoren lands in Tasik. Muharto is met by Pang, and army lieutenant who had called him, and reveals that his commander thought Freeberg was a spy and wanted to shoot him. They load up a jeep with two barrels of aviation fuel and drive to the beach. 

Muharto meets Pang Suparto, the army officer who had telephoned him, and
together they take two barrels of aviation fuel to the beach where
Freeberg is stranded. On seeing the beach, Muharto is astounded that
Freeberg was able to land there safely.

Muharto tells Cameron that in Tasik he met Pang Soeparto, the junior army officer who telephoned him, who takes him (and two barrels of aviation fuel) to the beach at Cikolong. He tells Cameron that as soon as he saw the beach, bookended by two rivers and the gap between the water and palm trees scarcely more than the Dakota's wing span, he knew that, of all the pilots he had met, only Bob Freeberg had the skill to make that landing.
Muharto receives a telephone call from an army base in Tasikmalaya, reporting that a foreign pilot has landed on a remote beach nearby and asked for Muharto by name.   

Petit Muharto sits at his desk. An airman approaches his desk and speaks
(without saluting first) that he someone wants to speak to him on the
telephone. Muharto looks surprised, stands and walks to a neighboring
office, where the only telephone in the building is kept. He listens
intently, discerning only a few words through the crackle of static:
"Tasikmalaya base", "Foreign pilot", "Captain Petit Muharto".

Muharto stands in the cockpit between Bob and his co-pilot, guiding the
aircraft by landmarks he has seen twice before on previous blockade
runs. But today, overcast obscures the terrain save tops of the
volcanoes poking through the clouds. Miss Brown, a comely Filipina who,
incongruously, is the stewardess on what is basically an illegal flight,
hands Muharto a cup of tea, then looks at the solid overcast with
obvious concern.

Bob points to the peaks and asks if there is any high ground in between.
Muharto thinks for a moment, then replies: I don't think so. Nothing
above a few hundred meters. To Muharto's horror, Bob noses the aircraft
down through the overcast, emerging perilously close to the terrain.
Muharto gulps, and frantically looks for any type of landmark. He sees a
rail line that he knows will lead them through valleys and plains all
the way to Jogja. He tells Bob to follow that line, and Jogja appears a
few minutes later, to Miss Brown's great relief.

Muharto takes Cameron to the Air Force museum in Jogja, a re-purposed
hanger filled with decommissioned aircraft and other exhibits. Muharto
points to a model of the Zogling training glider, and tells Cameron of
training village boys who had never seen an airplane to become skilled
pilots in mere weeks. Muharto seeks out the curator, who invites them
into his office. Muharto asks the curator to retrieve scraps from the
RI-002 wreckage stored at the museum. One of the items is the dynamo
with the bullet inexplicably lodged in the windings. Muharto picks it
up, and from his point of view, the room around him fades into mist. 

Muharto looks around to see he is in the radio nook of RI-002. The airplane shutters as the engines scream in protest. Muharto sees two shadowy figures in the pilot seats, and a forested mountainside fills the window. 

Then the curator's office room comes back into focus, and Muharto sees the concerned faces of
Cameron and the curator. Muharto places the dynamo back into the storage
box and says, in a wavering voice, he will miss his train back to Jakarta if he doesn't hurry.

Affandi is sketching at the edge of the runway, near where RI-002 is
parked. Bob walks up to him and compliments the sketch. Affandi, who
speaks some English, asks Bob to briefly pose for him. Affandi was
struck at the immense respect Bob enjoyed from military and government
officials, and the adoration, the outright hero worship, of the common
Indonesians. Affandi painted Freeberg standing in front of RI-002 as
though he were Bima, a hero in the wayang legends of ancient Java.
Freeberg, like Bima, was tall and imposing, strong and exceptionally
skilled. And, like Bima, Freeberg was modest and unpretentious, a gentle
soul in a warrior's body. --- date: April 1949 location: forest outside
