But the following morning, Indonesian soldiers appear. One points to the lack of registration on the Dakotas tail and shouts "*Mata-Mata*!", "Spy!" All point their rifles directly at Bob.

Muharto receives a telephone call at his desk in Maguwo Air Base near Jogjakarta. On the line is Pang Soeparto, an army lieutenant stationed in Tasikmalaya, forming him that an American landed an unmarked cargo aircraft on a nearby beach and is asking for him by name. The connection is poor, and Muharto can not make out the pilot's name or any other information.

and colleagues had contacted him from throughout Southeast Asia in
response to the article. All were eager to know what happened to
Freeberg and the gold. Muharto tells Cameron that he had attempted to
investigate the mystery a few years previously. Muharto describes his
farcical, frustrating attempts to wrest information from the
disorganized Air Force archives and government reference libraries

competent professionals. Muharto
suggests that they collaborate on new investigations with an eye to
writing a book. Cameron agrees, and Muharto suggests they begin with a

The following day, Cameron returns to the library for more research. He tells Julia about partnering with Muharto to investigate the mystery and the visit with Boediarjdo and his offer of assistance. Julia, with some enthusiasm, also offers to help, as she can easily read Dutch-language reports and records from the period. She also offers to introduce Cameron to Victor de Jong, a Dutch-born, naturalized Indonesian photographer who consults for the museum. Victor had been conscripted into the colonial military, and worked as a photographic assistant in the intelligence section. 

After Julia finishes work that afternoon, she takes Cameron to  visit Victor at the Indonesian Photo Agency, or IPPHOS, which he manages. Victor  illustrates his recollections of the time by finding and showing news photographs from 1947 and 1948. Candid shots of Spoor convey his commander's frustration and fury at reports of RI-002 evading his blockade with impunity.  

One of the photographs shows a beautiful, charismatic Indonesian woman standing before a painting. The caption reads: "Emeria Soenassa in her studio." Julia asks about her, but Victor is evasive, and shoves the photo back into a pile.

statesmans ideal of blending commanding authority with refined manners
and easy grace. The two old comrades revel in recounting their
experiences on RI-002, with Boediardjo filling in Cameron about missions
where Muharto was absent. He also recounts events that Muharto did not
mention, recalling Muharto's terror-stricken look during the November
1947 incident when Freeberg, who had flown through typhoons, dove into
the heart of a violent storm to evade a Dutch patrol.

Shortly before leaving, Muharto converses with Boedi's wife, presenting her with a gift from his wife.
