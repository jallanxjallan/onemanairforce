One beautiful morning in early June 1947, my desk-bound
   routine was broken when I received a message from the Republican Army Siliwangi Division base in Tasikmalaya, a town in the
   highlands of southwest Java, that a large aircraft had landed on
   a remote beach to their south. That was a remarkable enough
   occurrence, but I was astounded when told that the foreign occupant had asked for me by name.
         
I reported this news to Suryadarma, who agreed that this was
   worth an official investigation. Suryadarma ordered me to fly to Tasikmalaya and liaise with Army command there. Considering the
   urgency of the mission, Suryadarma instructed me to take the fastest
   aircraft in our motley fleet, a Nishikoren monoplane, for the journey.
         I would also have one our best pilots. Soenario, or Betet,
   as we called him, was one of the remarkable success stories of
   our fledgling air force. A year earlier, he had been a village boy
who had barely seen an airplane. Now, after only rudimentary
instruction on decrepit Japanese wrecks, he was at the controls of
a nimble, powerful military aircraft. But I had every confidence in
Betet, which was good, as only he was wearing a parachute.
      
In Tasikmalaya I reported to the base commander, who assigned Lieutenant Pang Soeparto as my liaison counterpart. The
foreigner had since returned to his aircraft, so Pang and I hopped
into a jeep for the drive to the beach. We arrived shortly before dusk
to see a Dakota, still in camouflage colors and with no markings
at all, parked on the sand halfway between the water and a line of
palm trees. It was not a bit damaged, indicating that this emergency
landing on a narrow strip of sandy beach had been a masterpiece.
      
During the journey, I had assumed that this had been an unannounced blockade run gone wrong, and wondered who might
be the pilot. As the former contact person for the CALI blockade
runs, many pilots would know my name and would consider me
as the obvious person to ask for assistance in an emergency such
as this. However, I knew that landing on an unprepared beach in
fading light would require piloting skills of a high order, and that
being in such a situation in the first place indicated an adventurous pilot. Therefore, as we drove up to the Dakota I was not the
least surprised to see Bob Freeberg, unshaven, unwashed, with the
bright expression of cheerful optimism that I would remember,
fondly, long after Bob himself was gone.
      
It was Bob's typical good fortune that the sand at the time of
landing, shortly after nightfall, had been moist and compact. But
now, after two days of hot sun, the sand was dry and loose and
the wheels had sunk twenty centimeters.
     
“Two days ago I kept rolling and rolling when I landed,” Bob said. “But now the plane doesn't budge an inch,
even when I apply full power.”

Bob introduced me to the two flight mechanics, whose love
   of adventure had overcome their quite-justified annoyance at being, basically, shanghaied. They were enjoying this mystery trip to
   an unknown destination, proudly explaining that the beach landing had been beautifully done and they were happy to be alive.
        
“The skipper is a good pilot,” one of them volunteered.
        
While Bob busied himself with his Dakota, the mechanics
   told me how they had come to be on this remote beach. Three
   days previously in Manila, Bob had offered them a token fee for
   what he had claimed to be a test flight. If the mechanics wondered why this test flight took off before dawn, they did not ask
   questions. But they were certainly surprised when the aircraft,
   once airborne, headed directly south toward Borneo, landing
   four hours later at Labuan to refuel. They knew they had been
   fooled, but their love of adventure won out, and they put their
   trust in this young American pilot.
        
They would soon discover how much adventure this flight
   had in store. Bob was navigating from a chart with a scale of one
   to ten million. The entire island of Java, stretching over a thousand kilometers from Sumatra to Bali, was only a ten-centimeter-long smudge on his map. Five hours out of Labuan, Bob spotted
   an island that he identified as Bawean, which on his chart is represented by a small dot in the Java Sea to the east of Madura. I
   believe that, in fact, he had flown over an island in the Karimun
   group some three hundred kilometers to the west. Bob continued
   southward, following what the chart indicated would be the correct bearing from Bawean to Jogjakarta – until he reached the
   south coast of Java, with a large town nowhere in sight.
        
Thinking he was still far to the east of his actual position,
   Bob headed westward, searching for familiar landmarks until he
   spotted a railway line. He explained to the mechanics that on his
   previous flight to Java he had navigated by following this railway line. Thinking that he was much further east than he was, he
had every reason to believe that following this line west would
take him directly to Jogjakarta.
      
Bob was therefore dumbfounded, and not a little concerned,
when it terminated in Purworejo. He flew north to south over mountainous territory until the light of the gibbous moon illuminated the
terrain. By nine p.m., his fuel was almost finished. Bob suggested
that he might ditch the aircraft and swim to shore with the help of
life vests stored in the cabin. But the stricken look on the faces of his
companions suggested that this would not be a viable option.
      
At last, Bob spotted a stretch of beach gleaming in the moonlight. With only a few liters of fuel left in the tanks, he set the
Dakota down without a scratch.
      
The beach seemed deserted. Bob and the mechanics performed their post-flight checklist and prepared to sleep on the
hard benches in the cabin. After several minutes, Bob saw flickers
of orange light through the cabin windows. He rose and cracked
open the rear cargo door. Indistinct figures, some holding flickering bamboo torches, were visible among the palms lining the
beach about fifty meters from the Dakota.
      
Several of the figures approached, stopping twenty meters
from the aircraft. One of them, a robust middle-aged man who
they later learned was the village headman, spoke a few words
in an unfamiliar language. Bob turned to the mechanics in hopes
of a translation. They only shrugged. Bob spoke in English, and
one of mechanics repeated the phrase in Tagalog. Bob and the
headman regarded each other in mutual incomprehension for
a few moments. The villagers spoke a few words to each other, then turned and walked back toward the line of palms. Bob
shrugged, and closed the rear door.
      
Two hours later, the chattering of voices and the flickers of torchlight through the windows awakened the crew.
Bob again opened the door to see the headman and his companions now standing only a few meters from the door. The
   headman handed his torch to a companion and made the
   universal signs of hospitality: bringing his bunched fingers to
   his mouth to indicate eating; tilting his head and laying his
   cheek on an open palm for sleep.
         
Bob turned to the mechanics, who knew better than to refuse an offer of hospitality when alone and defenseless in foreign
   territory. They gathered their gear, hopped onto the sand and
   slid the door closed. Bob motioned that no one was to touch the
   Dakota, and the headman nodded. They followed the villagers to
   the tidy cluster of raised wood-and-bamboo houses they called
   Cikalong. There, the crew were given a sparse but satisfying meal
   of rice and grilled fish, then invited to sleep on straw mats laid on
   the wooden floor of the headmans house.
         
The following morning Bob and his crew rose at dawn to
   make a visual inspection of the Dakota. The aircraft had no visible damage. Bob fired up the engines and attempted to roll the
   aircraft along the sand. The heavy Dakota would not budge, the
   wheels trapped in the soft sand.
         
A few villagers squatted at the treeline, enthralled that the
   aircraft had roared mightily, visibly straining, but could not free
   itself from the sand. The headman indicated that Bob should
   return with him to the village.
         
At the village, Bob was met by a squad of armed soldiers, one
   of whom spoke halting English. He informed Bob that he would
   need permission from the army command in the region to take
   off again. The soldier also noted that some of villagers thought he
   and his crew were Dutch spies and wanted to shoot them.
         
In late afternoon, Bob climbed into the army truck and embarked on a harrowing 60-kilometer ride over the coastal limestone
hills to the army base at Tasikmalaya. The six-hour trip over the
narrow road with bad hairpin turns and sheer drops on either side
kept Bob anxious the whole way. He finally arrived after midnight.
      
In Tasikmalaya Bob was able to explain his situation more
fully, including giving the officers the name of his one contact in
the Republic: Captain Petit Muharto.
      
Pang and I now had to decide what to do about the Dakota.
Though this village was staunchly Republican, many residents
of this region remained sympathetic to the Dutch. Chances grew
with each passing hour that the news of Bob's landing would
reach Dutch-controlled Batavia and prompt the dispatch of an air
patrol. Time was not on our side.
      
Bob had not yet grasped the seriousness of the situation. He
suggested we contact a Singaporean firm to ship perforated steel
plates by landing craft to the beach. I had to remind him that the
Dutch naval blockade would make this impossible.
      
More than a hundred villagers were standing around the
plane, some of them running their hands along the fuselage, unable to believe that such a colossus could fly. By this point almost
every Indonesian, even those living in remote areas, had seen an
airplane in the sky; but few had seen an aircraft up close. In this
hard-scrabble seaside village, the landing of Bob’s Dakota was a
welcome diversion. Life was hard even in the best of times in this
remote corner of Java. The villagers eked out a living through
fishing, rice cultivation on the narrow strip between the coast and
the Parahyangan range, and for the “lucky” few, penurious wages
working on nearby rubber plantations.
      
So, as usual in those times when even the most basic necessities were often unavailable, we improvised a solution using
whatever was on hand. We first attempted to make a runway of
woven coconut leaves. This failed as the strips could not take
the weight of the Dakota. By this time, hundreds more villagers,
   some from tens of kilometers away, had descended on the village. This crowd gave me an idea.
        
As is typical in Java, the houses in this village were constructed of woven bamboo matting attached to wooden support poles
   and beams. Bamboo is strong as well as pliable: a mat could easily
   support the heavy Dakota. Pang called together the heads of each
   nearby village. Using both our authority as military officers and
   appeals to the villagers desire for independence from their despised
   Dutch overlords, we convinced the leaders to mobilize the residents
   of their respective villages to weave a total of five hundred bamboo
   mats, in size and shape similar to the walls of their houses.
         
The villagers would need three days to complete the 500 mats.
   Since it was Bob’s intention to seek charter contracts with the
   Republicans, I decided we could best use this time to make such
   arrangements. Bob and I returned with Pang to his army base in
   Tasikmalaya. From there we boarded the Nishikoren for the thirty
   minute flight back to Jogjakarta to meet with Suryadarma.
         
The briefing with Suryadarma took less than thirty minutes.
   The Air Force commander explained that the Republic had a stock
   of quinine stored in Tasikmalaya. The anti-malaria drug would
   fetch a high price on the international market, but the Dutch had
   forbidden direct commercial transactions with the Republic. Suryadarma wanted Bob to sneak the quinine out from under the noses
   of the Dutch and fly it to Manila to be sold, along with some high-value vanilla beans stored in Jogjakarta. Bob agreed without hesitation, and we returned to Tasikmalaya with the Nishikoren.
        
We again wedged ourselves into the open rear cockpit, Bob
   plumping his large frame onto the deck of the aircraft lying flush
   on the bulkhead, me squatting between his feet, face-to-face. To
   take my mind off the discomfort during this thirty-minute flight, I
   studied the features of this remarkable foreigner, a cheerful, open
face highlighted by sky-blue eyes. The eyes, somehow, were both
piercing and kind, the eyes of a strict but fair military man who
would forgive you any mistake—if you made it only once.
      
Bob did not speak during the entire flight, as any conversation could scarcely be heard over the roar of the powerful engine
and the wind whipping past our ears. But I regarded Bob's reticence as fitting for a person of such extraordinary skill and confidence. Here was a man who had flown his aircraft single-handed
on a fifteen-hour flight to a destination in a foreign country he
had visited only once before, by a very different route, all the
while guided by a chart that showed critical navigational landmarks as mere specks in the ocean. Nevertheless, he could land
on an unprepared beach and take off again from an improvised
runway—all without much fuss. At the time, I wondered whether
he was extraordinarily skilled, incredibly lucky, or just an incurable optimist. In the following months, I would come to realize
that he was all three, and more besides.
      
Crammed into the open cockpit of what was currently the
most advanced aircraft in our armada, I saw clearly how the
Dakota, and Freeberg himself, could serve our revolution. Here
was an opportunity to do things off the beaten track—new ways
to outsmart the enemy. I was certain that the arrival of this
brave young pilot, literally dropping from the skies, might be a
turning point in our revolution.
      
The next morning, we again made the nerve-wracking drive
across the stark limestone hills to the beach at Cikalong, this time
carrying two drums of aviation fuel. We now had to wait two more
days, each moment dreading that we might hear the faint drone of
a Dutch patrol aircraft approaching the beach. To pass the time, I
visited the houses where the mats were being hand-woven.
      The four-square-meter mats, fashioned from five-centimeter-wide bamboo strips, represented prodigious (and wholly voluntary) effort by these impoverished villagers. Many would work at
night, then depart for another back-breaking day in the rice fields
or in fishing boats. I hoped they had not lost sleep for no reason.
      
On the morning of 8 June 1947, the 500 mats were finished. I ordered them laid in two 450-meter parallel strips the
width of the landing gear. As the mats were being put in position, Bob and I had the first of many disagreements which would
mark the time of our professional collaboration. I felt the mats
should overlap in the direction of travel, while Bob insisted on
the opposite. I forget which of us prevailed on that occasion, but
I do remember a spirited argument.
     
The Dakota would take off with thirty minutes total
fuel, the 92-octane fuel I brought from Tasikmalaya mixed
with the traces of 100-octane fuel remaining in the tanks. We
scraped the sand from around the main landing wheels. Bob
revved the engines to full power. Pang, myself, and scores of
villagers strained at the tires until, with a lurch, the Dakota
rolled onto the first mat of our improvised runway. Pang and
I then thanked the villagers for their assistance and joined Bob
and the two mechanics on board.
     
“Now, watch the air speed,” Bob told one of the mechanics,
who was sitting in the right-hand seat. “As soon as we reach sixty,
get the flaps down full, okay?”
      
Off we went. I felt a sudden heave as the flaps went down
and we were airborne. We made a wide, shallow, climbing turn
over the Indian Ocean, then passed over the landing site to see
that the matting was scattered all over the sand by the propeller
backwash. With Pang navigating, we headed inland, landing in
Tasikmalaya thirty minutes later with no fuel to spare.
