<p>The contribution of the United States to Indonesia's struggle to achieve
independence is often overlooked. Indonesia's founders consciously
modeled themselves after George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and other
American counterparts, and American representatives championed the
formation of the three-member commission charged with resolving the
dispute between the Republican government and the Netherlands.</p>
<p>Even less known, and perhaps more important, is the role played by a
lone American aviator during the critical period when the Dutch colonial
government attempted to isolate the nascent Republic of Indonesia behind
an air-and-sea blockade. From June 1947 to September 1948, Bob Freeberg,
a veteran Navy pilot from Kansas, ran the Dutch air blockade in a
war-surplus C-47 proudly emblazoned with the first Indonesian aircraft
identification number: RI-002. He dodged Dutch air patrols to fly from
Jogjakarta and Bukittinggi to neighboring nations, transporting cargoes
to trade for essential items such as medicine, and diplomats tasked with
making their case for national sovereignty on the global stage.
Freeberg's contribution to founding the Indonesian nation came to an
abrupt end in October 1948, when RI-002 disappeared into the mountains
of southern Sumatra while transporting a cargo of Republican gold.</p>
<p>Now, the story of Bob Freeberg will be told by the Indonesian who knew
him best. As official mission leader and (unofficial) copilot, Petit
Muharto flew with Freeberg until he was promoted and reassigned to
headquarters shortly before the tragic final flight. A story of two
young aviators from opposite ends of the globe forging a close
friendship based on both professional respect and revolutionary
camaraderie, <strong>One Man Air Force</strong> is the compelling account of the
birth of a nation, and the role of the new nation's own courageous
aviators in providing crucial support to the military and diplomatic
offensives that finally won freedom for all Indonesians.</p>
