 Cameron returns to library. He uses this as an excuse to revisit the library and meet Julia again. He tells of meeting Muharto, and asks for her help in finding research material. Julia says she knows just the person who can help, and introduces Cameron to an older man, disheveled but still dignified, who is at a reading table. He is Victor, a former journalist. Victor explains that during the struggle for independence he was a journalist for the BN. He tells of almost comical interviews with Dutch officials, who were driven to distraction by Freebergâ€™s blockade runs. He says that he also was intrigued by the disappearance of RI-002, but was stonewalled by the Dutch officials, who insisted they knew nothing.
