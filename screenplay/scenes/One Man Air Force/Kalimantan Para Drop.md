â€¢     Bob drops paratroopers into a Republican area. It was the first jump for everyone, and many are terrified. One soldier pulls his ripcord, spilling his parachute on the deck. He swears it was an accident, but others grip their cords, possibly ready to do the same. Later, Bob discovers that all had been killed by the Dutch commandos within hours.
