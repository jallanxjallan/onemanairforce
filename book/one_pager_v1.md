Maria is an Indonesian journalism student in a relationship with an American USAID volunteer. After the end of his assignment, he wants to stay in Indonesia so they can be together, but run into numerous obstacles set up by the government. This gist is that foreigners are here only to exploit Indonesia, to take the money (and in this case, women) and run. 

The boyfriend suggests they marry and return together to the US, but Maria is working with a foreign scholar and does not want to interrupt her studies, or leave Indonesia. She is from a middle-class background and could not afford to study in Indonesia, esp since the boyfriend want to go to grad school. 

A friend of her father sends her to Boediardjo, a former government minister. He calls in a favor and asks a friend to hire the boyfriend to teach English to his employees, as they are pushing to open export markets, to reach out to the world. 

Boedi sparks Maria's interest with the story of his adventures with Bob Freeberg. Through the recollections of Boedi and others, we learn of the relationship between Bob and Petit Muharto, which grew from a kind of patronization of the high-born Indonesian, to growing respect as Muharto proves useful in many situations, to friction as Muharto smuggles guns without Bob's knowledge. 

Bob also has a fractious relationship with Suryadarma, and entitled aristocrat who treats Bob as though a subordinate officer. 

Bob is under increasing pressure without Muharto, as he is flying opium and cannot rely on his crew accept for Boedi, who is the youngest member and only the radio operator who has no influence with co-pilot Bambang, who both worships and resents Bob and wants to gain his two-engine certification.

Maria discovers that in his golden years, Muharto is haunted by the suspicion that his friend betrayed him, and all Indonesians. Maria helps his investigate, in the process uncovering the attempted coup.

Muharto takes Maria to visit Verspoor, who might hold a secret. He, finally, reveals that Spoor was planning a coup. That, along with her library search finding the photo of RI-002 guarded by a KNIL soldier.
